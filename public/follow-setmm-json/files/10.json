{"index":10,"title":"Logical disjunction","content":"This section defines disjunction of two formulas, denoted by infix \" ` \\/ ` \" and read \"or\". It is defined in terms of implication and negation, which is possible in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm). This section contains only theorems proved without ~ df-an (theorems that are proved using ~ df-an are deferred to the next section). Basic theorems that help simplifying and applying disjunction are ~ olc , ~ orc , and ~ orcom . As mentioned in the \"note on definitions\" in the section comment for logical equivalence, all theorems in this and the previous section can be stated in terms of implication and negation only. Additionally, in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm), it is also possible to translate conjunction into disjunction and conversely via the De Morgan law ~ anor : conjunction and disjunction are dual connectives. Either is sufficient to develop all propositional calculus of the logic (together with implication and negation). In practice, conjunction is more efficient, its big advantage being the possibility to use it to group antecedents in a convenient way, using ~ imp and ~ ex as noted in the previous section. An illustration of the conservativity of ~ df-an is given by ~ orim12dALT , which is an alternate proof of ~ orim12d not using ~ df-an .","blocks":[{"name":"wo","content":"Extend wff definition to include disjunction (\"or\").","origin":"prop wff wo(wff w0, wff w1) { (w0 ∨ w1) }","pretty":"","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.wo.s","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.wo.s(setvar sBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  |- diffsw(sBase, wo(w0, w1))\n  -| diffsw(sBase, w0)\n  -| diffsw(sBase, w1)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.wo.s(setvar sBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  ⊢ d(sBase,(w0 ∨ w1))\n  ⊣ d(sBase, w0)\n  ⊣ d(sBase, w1)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.wo.c","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.wo.c(class cBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  |- diffcw(cBase, wo(w0, w1))\n  -| diffcw(cBase, w0)\n  -| diffcw(cBase, w1)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.wo.c(class cBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  ⊢ d(cBase,(w0 ∨ w1))\n  ⊣ d(cBase, w0)\n  ⊣ d(cBase, w1)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.wo.w","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.wo.w(wff wBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  |- diffww(wBase, wo(w0, w1))\n  -| diffww(wBase, w0)\n  -| diffww(wBase, w1)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.wo.w(wff wBase, wff w0, wff w1) {\n  ⊢ d(wBase,(w0 ∨ w1))\n  ⊣ d(wBase, w0)\n  ⊣ d(wBase, w1)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"df-or","content":"Define disjunction (logical \"or\").
