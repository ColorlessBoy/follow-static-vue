{"index":18,"title":"Universal quantifier for use by df-tru","content":"Even though it isn't ordinarily part of propositional calculus, the universal quantifier ` A. ` is introduced here so that the soundness of definition ~ df-tru can be checked by the same algorithm that is used for predicate calculus. Its first real use is in definition ~ df-ex in the predicate calculus section below. For those who want propositional calculus to be self-contained i.e. to use wff variables only, the alternate definition ~ dftru2 may be adopted and this subsection moved down to the start of the subsection with ~ wex below. However, the use of ~ dftru2 as a definition requires a more elaborate definition checking algorithm that we prefer to avoid.","blocks":[{"name":"wal","content":"Extend wff definition to include the universal quantifier (\"for all\"). ` A. x ph ` is read \" ` ph ` (phi) is true for all ` x ` \". Typically, in its final application ` ph ` would be replaced with a wff containing a (free) occurrence of the variable ` x ` , for example ` x = y ` . In a universe with a finite number of objects, \"for all\" is equivalent to a big conjunction (AND) with one wff for each possible case of ` x ` . When the universe is infinite (as with set theory), such a propositional-calculus equivalent is not possible because an infinitely long formula has no meaning, but conceptually the idea is the same.","origin":"prop wff wal(setvar s0, wff w0) { âˆ€(s0, w0) }","pretty":"","parent":[],"children":[]}]}
