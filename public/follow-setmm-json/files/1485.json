{"index":1485,"title":"Even and odd numbers","content":"Even and odd numbers can be characterized in many different ways. In the following, the definition of even and odd numbers is based on the fact that dividing an even number (resp. an odd number increased by 1) by 2 is an integer, see ~ df-even and ~ df-odd . Alternate definitions resp. charaterizations are provided in ~ dfeven2 , ~ dfeven3 , ~ dfeven4 and in ~ dfodd2 , ~ dfodd3 , ~ dfodd4 , ~ dfodd5 , ~ dfodd6 . Each characterization can be useful (and used) in an appropriate context, e.g. ~ dfodd6 in ~ opoeALTV and ~ dfodd3 in ~ oddprmALTV . Having a fixed definition for even and odd numbers, and alternate characterizations as theorems, advanced theorems about even and/or odd numbers can be expressed more explicitly, and the appropriate characterization can be chosen for their proof, which may become clearer and sometimes also shorter (see, for example, ~ divgcdoddALTV and ~ divgcdodd ).","blocks":[]}
