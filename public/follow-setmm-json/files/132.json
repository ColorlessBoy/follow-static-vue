For example, ` ( cos `` 0 ) = 1 ` (we prove this in ~ cos0 after we define cosine in ~ df-cos ). Typically, function ` F ` is defined using maps-to notation (see ~ df-mpt and ~ df-mpo ), but this is not required. For example, ` F = { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } -> ( F `` 3 ) = 9 ` ( ~ ex-fv ). Note that ~ df-ov will define two-argument functions using ordered pairs as ` ( A F B ) = ( F `` <. A , B >. ) ` . This particular definition is quite convenient: it can be applied to any class and evaluates to the empty set when it is not meaningful (as shown by ~ ndmfv and ~ fvprc ). The left apostrophe notation originated with Peano and was adopted in Definition *30.01 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 235, Definition 10.11 of [Quine] p. 68, and Definition 6.11 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 26. It means the same thing as the more familiar ` F ( A ) ` notation for a function's value at ` A ` , i.e., \" ` F ` of ` A ` \", but without context-dependent notational ambiguity. Alternate definitions are ~ dffv2 , ~ dffv3 , ~ fv2 , and ~ fv3 (the latter two previously required ` A ` to be a set.) Restricted equivalents that require ` F ` to be a function are shown in ~ funfv and ~ funfv2 . For the familiar definition of function value in terms of ordered pair membership, see ~ funopfvb .

Because of the definition ~ df-fv of the value of a function, the theorem is only valid in general if the empty set is not contained in the range of the function (the implication \"to the right\" is always valid). Indeed, with the definition ~ df-fv of the value of a function, ` ( F `` Y ) = (/) ` may mean that the value of ` F ` at ` Y ` is the empty set or that ` F ` is not defined at ` Y ` .
