{"index":292,"title":"Reflexive and transitive closures of relations","content":"A relation, ` R ` , has the reflexive property if ` A R A ` holds whenever ` A ` is an element which could be related by the relation, namely, an element of its domain or range. Eliminating dummy variables, we see that a segment of the identity relation must be a subset of the relation, or ` ( _I |`` ( ran R u. dom R ) ) C_ R ` . See ~ idref . A relation, ` R ` , has the transitive property if ` A R C ` holds whenever there exists an intermediate value ` B ` such that both ` A R B ` and ` B R C ` hold. This can be expressed without dummy variables as ` ( R o. R ) C_ R ` . See ~ cotr . The transitive closure of a relation, ` ( t+ `` R ) ` , is the smallest superset of the relation which has the transitive property. Likewise, the reflexive-transitive closure, ` ( t* `` R ) ` , is the smallest superset which has both the reflexive and transitive properties. Not to be confused with the transitive closure of a set, ~ trcl , which is a closure relative to a different transitive property, ~ df-tr .","blocks":[]}
