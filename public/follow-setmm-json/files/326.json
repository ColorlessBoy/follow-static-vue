Various notations have been used or proposed for this number including ` _tau ` , a three-legged variant of ` _pi ` , or ` 2 _pi ` . Note the difference between this constant ` _tau ` and the formula variable ` ta ` . Following our convention, the constant is displayed in upright font while the variable is in italic font; furthermore, the colors are different. (Contributed by Jim Kingdon, 9-Apr-2018.)
