{"index":191,"title":"ZFC (ZERMELO-FRAENKEL WITH CHOICE) SET THEORY","content":"In this section we add the Axiom of Choice ~ ax-ac , as well as weaker forms such as the axiom of countable choice ~ ax-cc and dependent choice ~ ax-dc . We introduce these weaker forms so that theorems that do not need the full power of the axiom of choice, but need more than simple ZF, can use these intermediate axioms instead. The combination of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms and the axiom of choice is often abbreviated as ZFC. The axiom of choice is widely accepted, and ZFC is the most commonly-accepted fundamental set of axioms for mathematics. However, there have been and still are some lingering controversies about the Axiom of Choice. The axiom of choice does not satisfy those who wish to have a constructive proof (e.g., it will not satisfy intuitionistic logic). Thus, we make it easy to identify which proofs depend on the axiom of choice or its weaker forms.","blocks":[]}
