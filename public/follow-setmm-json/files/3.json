{"index":3,"title":"Propositional calculus","content":"Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed. The simplest propositional truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read \"if something is true, then it is true\" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from the axioms (see theorem ~ id ). Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule. It is attributed to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by Alonzo Church, who called it system P2. (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this information.) These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems. The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by mathematicians. In particular, this logic system accepts the \"law of the excluded middle\" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement is either true or not true. This is an essential distinction of classical logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic. All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or formally proven.
