{"index":45,"title":"Stoic logic non-modal portion (Chrysippus of Soli)","content":"The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic called Stoic logic. The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest logicians of antiquity. Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses on propositional logic, though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle. Jan Lukasiewicz reports, \"For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic\" ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934), translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski - Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217, referenced in \"History of Logic, ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ). In this section we show that the propositional logic system we use (which is non-modal) is at least as strong as the non-modal portion of Stoic logic. We show this by showing that our system assumes or proves all of key features of Stoic logic's non-modal portion (specifically the Stoic logic indemonstrables, themata, and principles). \"In terms of contemporary logic, Stoic syllogistic is best understood as a substructural backwards-working Gentzen-style natural-deduction system that consists of five kinds of axiomatic arguments (the indemonstrables) and four inference rules, called themata. An argument is a syllogism precisely if it either is an indemonstrable or can be reduced to one by means of the themata (Diogenes Laertius (D. L. 7.78)).\" (_Ancient Logic_, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ~ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ). There are also a few \"principles\" that support logical reasoning, discussed below. For more information, see \"Stoic Logic\" by Susanne Bobzien, especially [Bobzien] p. 110-120, especially for a discussion about the themata (including how they were reconstructed and how they were used). There are differences in the systems we can only partly represent, for example, in Stoic logic \"truth and falsehood are temporal properties of assertibles... They can belong to an assertible at one time but not at another\" ([Bobzien] p. 87). Stoic logic also included various kinds of modalities, which we do not include here since our basic propositional logic does not include modalities. A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five \"indemonstrables\" assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in general it is difficult to assign specific ideas to specific thinkers. The indemonstrables are described in, for example, [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5. These indemonstrables are modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp , modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto , modus ponendo tollens I ~ mptnan , modus ponendo tollens II ~ mptxor , and modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtpxor . The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section we prove the other three. Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtpxor originally used exclusive-or, but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtpor . After we prove the indemonstratables, we then prove all the Stoic logic themata (the inference rules of Stoic logic; \"thema\" is singular). This is straightforward for thema 1 ( ~ stoic1a and ~ stoic1b ) and thema 3 ( ~ stoic3 ). However, while Stoic logic was once a leading logic system, most direct information about Stoic logic has since been lost, including the exact texts of thema 2 and thema 4. There are, however, enough references and specific examples to support reconstruction. Themata 2 and 4 have been reconstructed; see statements T2 and T4 in [Bobzien] p. 110-120 and our proofs of them in ~ stoic2a , ~ stoic2b , ~ stoic4a , and ~ stoic4b . Stoic logic also had a set of principles involving assertibles. Statements in [Bobzien] p. 99 express the known principles. The following paragraphs discuss these principles and our proofs of them. \"A principle of double negation, expressed by saying that a double-negation (Not: not: p) is equivalent to the assertible that is doubly negated (p) (DL VII 69).\" In other words, ` ( ph <-> -. -. ph ) ` as proven in ~ notnotb . \"The principle that all conditionals that are formed by using the same assertible twice (like 'If p, p') are true (Cic. Acad. II 98).\" In other words, ` ( ph -> ph ) ` as proven in ~ id . \"The principle that all disjunctions formed by a contradiction (like 'Either p or not: p') are true (S. E. M VIII 282).\" Remember that in Stoic logic, 'or' means 'exclusive or'. In other words, ` ( ph \\/_ -. ph ) ` as proven in ~ xorexmid . [Bobzien] p. 99 also suggests that Stoic logic may have dealt with commutativity (see ~ xorcom and ~ ancom ) and the principle of contraposition ( ~ con4 ) (pointing to DL VII 194). In short, the non-modal propositional logic system we use is at least as strong as the non-modal portion of Stoic logic. For more about Aristotle's system, see ~ barbara and related theorems.","blocks":[{"name":"mptnan","content":"Modus ponendo tollens 1, one of the \"indemonstrables\" in Stoic logic.
