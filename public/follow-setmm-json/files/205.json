{"index":205,"title":"TG (TARSKI-GROTHENDIECK) SET THEORY","content":"Here we introduce Tarski-Grothendieck (TG) set theory, named after mathematicians Alfred Tarski and Alexander Grothendieck. TG theory extends ZFC with the TG Axiom ~ ax-groth , which states that for every set ` x ` there is an inaccessible cardinal ` y ` such that ` y ` is not in ` x ` . The addition of this axiom to ZFC set theory provides a framework for category theory, thus for all practical purposes giving us a complete foundation for \"all of mathematics.\" We first introduce the concept of inaccessibles, including weakly and strongly inaccessible cardinals ( ~ df-wina and ~ df-ina respectively ), Tarski classes ( ~ df-tsk ), and Grothendieck universes ( ~ df-gru ). We then introduce the Tarski's axiom ~ ax-groth and prove various properties from that.","blocks":[]}
