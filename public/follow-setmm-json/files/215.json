{"index":215,"title":"REAL AND COMPLEX NUMBERS","content":"This section derives the basics of real and complex numbers. We first construct and axiomatize real and complex numbers (e.g., ~ ax-resscn ). After that, we derive their basic properties, various operations like addition ( ~ df-add ) and sine ( ~ df-sin ), and subsets such as the integers ( ~ df-z ) and natural numbers ( ~ df-nn ).","blocks":[]}
