{"index":11,"title":"Mixed connectives","content":"This section gathers theorems of propositional calculus which use (either in their statement or proof) mixed connectives (at least conjunction and disjunction). As noted in the \"note on definitions\" in the section comment for logical equivalence, some theorem statements may contain for instance only conjunction or only disjunction, but both definitions are used in their proofs to make them shorter (this is exemplified in ~ orim12d versus ~ orim12dALT ). These theorems are mostly grouped at the beginning of this section. The family of theorems starting with ~ animorl focus on the relation between conjunction and disjunction and can be seen as the starting point of mixed connectives in statements. This sectioning is not rigorously true, since for instance the section begins with ~ jaao and related theorems.","blocks":[{"name":"jaao","content":"Inference conjoining and disjoining the antecedents of two implications.
