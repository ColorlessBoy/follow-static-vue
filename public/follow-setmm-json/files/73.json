{"index":73,"title":"ZF (ZERMELO-FRAENKEL) SET THEORY","content":"Set theory uses the formalism of propositional and predicate calculus to assert properties of arbitrary mathematical objects called \"sets\". A set can be an element of another set, and this relationship is indicated by the ` e. ` symbol. Starting with the simplest mathematical object, called the empty set, set theory builds up more and more complex structures whose existence follows from the axioms, eventually resulting in extremely complicated sets that we identify with the real numbers and other familiar mathematical objects. A simplistic concept of sets, sometimes called \"naive set theory\", is vulnerable to a paradox called \"Russell's Paradox\" ( ~ ru ), a discovery that revolutionized the foundations of mathematics and logic. Russell's Paradox spawned the development of set theories that countered the paradox, including the ZF set theory that is most widely used and is defined here. Except for Extensionality, the axioms basically say, \"given an arbitrary set x (and, in the cases of Replacement and Regularity, provided that an antecedent is satisfied), there exists another set y based on or constructed from it, with the stated properties\". (The axiom of Extensionality can also be restated this way as shown by ~ axext2 .) The individual axiom links provide more detailed descriptions. We derive the redundant ZF axioms of Separation, Null Set, and Pairing from the others as theorems.","blocks":[]}
