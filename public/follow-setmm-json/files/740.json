{"index":740,"title":"COMPLEX TOPOLOGICAL VECTOR SPACES (DEPRECATED)","content":"The intent is for this deprecated section to be deleted once its theorems have extensible structure versions (or are not useful). You can make a list of \"terminal\" theorems (i.e., theorems not referenced by anything else) and for each theorem see if there exists an extensible structure version (or decide it is not useful), and if so, delete it. Then, repeat this recursively. One way to search for terminal theorems is to log the output (\"MM> OPEN LOG xxx.txt\") of \"MM> SHOW USAGE <label-match>\" in metamath.exe and search for \"(None)\".","blocks":[]}
