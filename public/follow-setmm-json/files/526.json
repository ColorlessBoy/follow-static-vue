{"index":526,"title":"Topological spaces","content":"A topology on a set is a set of subsets of that set, called open sets, which satisfy certain conditions. One condition is that the whole set be an open set. Therefore, a set is recoverable from a topology on it (as its union, see ~ toponuni ), and it may sometimes be more convenient to consider topologies without reference to the underlying set. This is why we define successively the class of topologies ( ~ df-top ), then the function which associates with a set the set of topologies on it ( ~ df-topon ), and finally the class of topological spaces, as extensible structures having an underlying set and a topology on it ( ~ df-topsp ). Of course, a topology is the same thing as a topology on a set (see ~ toprntopon ).","blocks":[]}
