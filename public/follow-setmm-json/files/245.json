To avoid the need to distinguish between finite and infinite sets (and therefore if the set size is a nonnegative integer or positive infinity), it is useful to provide a definition of the set of nonnegative integers extended by positive infinity, analogously to the extension of the real numbers ` RR* ` , see ~ df-xr . The definition of extended nonnegative integers can be used in Ramsey theory, because the Ramsey number is either a nonnegative integer or plus infinity, see ~ ramcl2 , or for the degree of polynomials, see ~ mdegcl , or for the degree of vertices in graph theory, see ~ vtxdgf .","blocks":[{"name":"cxnn0","content":"The set of extended nonnegative integers.","origin":"const class cxnn0 { ℕ0* }","pretty":"","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.cxnn0.s","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.cxnn0.s(setvar s0) {\n  |- diffsc(s0, cxnn0)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.cxnn0.s(setvar s0) {\n  ⊢ d(s0, ℕ0*)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.cxnn0.c","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.cxnn0.c(class c0) {\n  |- diffcc(cxnn0, c0)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.cxnn0.c(class c0) {\n  ⊢ d(ℕ0*, c0)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"diff.cxnn0.w","content":"","origin":"axiom diff.cxnn0.w(wff w0) {\n  |- diffcw(cxnn0, w0)\n}","pretty":"axiom diff.cxnn0.w(wff w0) {\n  ⊢ d(ℕ0*, w0)\n}","parent":[],"children":[]},{"name":"df-xnn0","content":"Define the set of extended nonnegative integers that includes positive infinity.
