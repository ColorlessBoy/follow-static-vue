{"index":1092,"title":"Connective Symmetry","content":"","blocks":[{"name":"negsym1","content":"In the paper \"On Variable Functors of Propositional Arguments\", Lukasiewicz introduced a system that can handle variable connectives. This was done by introducing a variable, marked with a lowercase delta, which takes a wff as input. In the system, \"delta ` ph ` \" means that \"something is true of ` ph ` \". The expression \"delta ` ph ` \" can be substituted with ` -. ph ` , ` ps /\\ ph ` , ` A. x ph ` , etc. Later on, Meredith discovered a single axiom, in the form of ` ( ` delta delta ` F. -> ` delta ` ph ` ` ) ` . This represents the shortest theorem in the extended propositional calculus that cannot be derived as an instance of a theorem in propositional calculus. A symmetry with ` -. ` .
