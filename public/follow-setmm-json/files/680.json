{"index":680,"title":"Vertices and edges","content":"In the following, the vertices and (indexed) edges for an arbitrary class ` G ` (called \"graph\" in the following) are defined and examined. The main result of this section is to show that the set of vertices ` ( Vtx `` G ) ` of a graph ` G ` is the first component ` V ` of the graph ` G ` if it is represented by an ordered pair ` <. V , E >. ` (see ~ opvtxfv ), or the base set ` ( Base `` G ) ` of the graph ` G ` if it is represented as extensible structure (see ~ basvtxval ), and that the set of indexed edges resp. the edge function ` ( iEdg `` G ) ` is the second component ` E ` of the graph ` G ` if it is represented by an ordered pair ` <. V , E >. ` (see ~ opiedgfv ), or the component ` ( .ef `` G ) ` of the graph ` G ` if it is represented as extensible structure (see ~ edgfiedgval ). Finally, it is shown that the set of edges of a graph ` G ` is the range of its edge function: ` ( Edg `` G ) = ran ( iEdg `` G ) `, see ~ edgval . Usually, a graph ` G ` is a set. If ` G ` is a proper class, however, it represents the null graph (without vertices and edges), because ` ( Vtx `` G ) = (/) ` and ` ( iEdg `` G ) = (/) ` holds, see ~ vtxvalprc and ~ iedgvalprc . Up to the end of this section, the edges need not be related to the vertices. Once undirected hypergraphs are defined (see ~ df-uhgr ), the edges become nonempty sets of vertices, and by this obtain their meaning as \"connectors\" of vertices.","blocks":[]}
