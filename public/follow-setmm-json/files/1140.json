{"index":1140,"title":"Characterization among sets versus among classes","content":"","blocks":[{"name":"elelb","content":"Equivalence between two common ways to characterize elements of a class ` B ` : the LHS says that sets are elements of ` B ` if and only if they satisfy ` ph ` while the RHS says that classes are elements of ` B ` if and only if they are sets and satisfy ` ph ` . Therefore, the LHS is a characterization among sets while the RHS is a characterization among classes. Note that the LHS is often formulated using a class variable instead of the universe ` _V ` while this is not possible for the RHS (apart from using ` B ` itself, which would not be very useful).
