{"index":61,"title":"Predicate calculus with equality: Auxiliary axiom schemes (4 schemes)","content":"In this section we introduce four additional schemes ~ ax-10 , ~ ax-11 , ~ ax-12 , and ~ ax-13 that are not part of Tarski's system but can be proved (outside of Metamath) as theorem schemes of Tarski's system. These are needed to give our system the property of \"scheme completeness\", which means that we can prove (with Metamath) all possible theorem schemes expressible in our language of wff metavariables ranging over object-language wffs, and setvar variables ranging over object-language individual variables. To show that these schemes are valid metatheorems of Tarski's system S2, above we proved from Tarski's system theorems ~ ax10w , ~ ax11w , ~ ax12w , and ~ ax13w , which show that any object-language instance of these schemes (emulated by having no wff metavariables and requiring all setvar variables to be mutually distinct) can be proved using only the schemes in Tarski's system S2. An open problem is to show that these four additional schemes are mutually _metalogically_ independent and metalogically independent from Tarski's. So far, independence of ~ ax-12 from all others has been shown, and independence of Tarski's ~ ax-6 from all others has been shown; see items 9a and 11 on ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html .","blocks":[]}
