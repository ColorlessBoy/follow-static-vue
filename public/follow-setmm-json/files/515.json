{"index":515,"title":"Polynomial matrices","content":"A _polynomial matrix_ or _matrix of polynomials_ is a matrix whose elements are univariate (or multivariate) polynomials. See Wikipedia \"Polynomial matrix\" ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_matrix (18-Nov-2019). In this section, only square matrices whose elements are univariate polynomials are considered. Usually, the ring of such matrices, the ring of n x n matrices over the polynomial ring over a ring ` R ` , is denoted by M(n, R[[t]). The elements of this ring are called \"polynomial matrices (over the ring ` R ` )\" in the following. In Metamath notation, this ring is defined by ` ( N Mat ( Poly1 `` R ) ) ` , usually represented by the class variable ` C ` (or ` Y ` , if ` C ` is already occupied): ` C = ( N Mat P ) ` with ` P = ( Poly1 `` R ) ` .","blocks":[]}
