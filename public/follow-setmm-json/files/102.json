Since the behavior of Kuratowski definition is not very useful for proper classes, we define it to be empty in this case (see ~ opprc1 , ~ opprc2 , and ~ 0nelop ). For Kuratowski's actual definition when the arguments are sets, see ~ dfop . For the justifying theorem (for sets) see ~ opth . See ~ dfopif for an equivalent formulation using the ` if ` operation. Definition 9.1 of [Quine] p. 58 defines an ordered pair unconditionally as ` <. A , B >. = { { A } , { A , B } } ` , which has different behavior from our ~ df-op when the arguments are proper classes. Ordinarily this difference is not important, since neither definition is meaningful in that case. Our ~ df-op was chosen because it often makes proofs shorter by eliminating unnecessary sethood hypotheses. There are other ways to define ordered pairs. The basic requirement is that two ordered pairs are equal iff their respective members are equal. In 1914 Norbert Wiener gave the first successful definition ` <. A , B >. ` _2 ` = { { { A } , (/) } , { { B } } } ` , justified by ~ opthwiener . This was simplified by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1921 to our present definition. An even simpler definition ` <. A , B >. ` _3 ` = { A , { A , B } } ` is justified by ~ opthreg , but it requires the Axiom of Regularity for its justification and is not commonly used. A definition that also works for proper classes is ` <. A , B >. ` _4 ` = ( ( A X. { (/) } ) u. ( B X. { { (/) } } ) ) ` , justified by ~ opthprc . Nearly at the same time as Norbert Wiener, Felix Hausdorff proposed the following definition in \"Grundz&uuml;ge der Mengenlehre\" (\"Basics of Set Theory\"), p. 32, in 1914: ` <. A , B >. ` _5 ` = { { A , O } , { B , T } } ` . Hausdorff used ` 1 ` and ` 2 ` instead of ` O ` and ` T ` , but actually any two different fixed sets will do (e.g., ` O = (/) ` and ` T = { (/) } ` , see ~ 0nep0 ). Furthermore, Hausdorff demanded that ` O ` and ` T ` are both different from ` A ` as well as ` B ` , which is actually not necessary (at least not in full extent), see ~ opthhausdorff0 and ~ opthhausdorff . If we restrict our sets to nonnegative integers, an ordered pair definition that involves only elementary arithmetic is provided by ~ nn0opthi . An ordered pair of real numbers can also be represented by a complex number as shown by ~ cru . Kuratowski's ordered pair definition is standard for ZFC set theory, but it is very inconvenient to use in New Foundations theory because it is not type-level; a common alternate definition in New Foundations is the definition from [Rosser] p. 281. Since there are other ways to define ordered pairs, we discourage direct use of this definition so that most theorems won't depend on this particular construction; theorems will instead rely on ~ dfopif .
