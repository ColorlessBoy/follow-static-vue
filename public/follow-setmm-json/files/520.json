{"index":520,"title":"The characteristic polynomial","content":"According to Wikipedia (\"Characteristic polynomial\", 31-Jul-2019, ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial ): \"In linear algebra, the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is a polynomial which is invariant under matrix similarity and has the eigenvalues as roots. It has the determinant and the trace of the matrix as coefficients.\". Based on the definition of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix ( ~ df-chpmat ) the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors can be defined.","blocks":[]}
