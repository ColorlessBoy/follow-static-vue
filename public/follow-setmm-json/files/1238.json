A quantified wff implies the wff without a quantifier (i.e. an instance, or special case, of the generalized wff). In other words if something is true for all ` x ` , it is true for any specific ` x ` (that would typically occur as a free variable in the wff substituted for ` ph ` ). (A free variable is one that does not occur in the scope of a quantifier: ` x ` and ` y ` are both free in ` x = y ` , but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .) Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski] p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77). Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule ~ ax-gen . Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-13 , ~ ax-c14 , ~ ax-c16 , and ~ ax-5 . Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose a variable different from ` x ` for the special case. For use, that requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later after we introduce the definition of proper substitution - see ~ stdpc4 .

It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases. To understand this theorem more easily, think of \" ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ...\" as informally meaning \"if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then...\" The antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case. In some later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a \"distinctor.\" Interestingly, if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no wff variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking this axiom. This means that even though this axiom is _metalogically_ independent from the others, it is not _logically_ independent. Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of axiom ~ ax-c15 (from which the ~ ax-12 instance follows by theorem ~ ax12 .) The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax12eq and ~ ax12el for the basis steps and ~ ax12indn , ~ ax12indi , and ~ ax12inda for the induction steps.
