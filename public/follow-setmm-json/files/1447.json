{"index":1447,"title":"Alternative definitions of function values (2)","content":"In the following, a second approach is followed to define function values alternately to ~ df-afv . The current definition of the value ` ( F `` A ) ` of a function ` F ` at an argument ` A ` (see ~ df-fv ) assures that this value is always a set, see ~ fex . This is because this definition can be applied to any classes ` F ` and ` A ` , and evaluates to the empty set when it is not meaningful (as shown by ~ ndmfv and ~ fvprc ). \"` ( F `` A ) ` is meaningful\" means \"the class ` F ` regarded as function is defined at the argument ` A `\" in this context. This is also expressed by ` F defAt A `, see ~ df-dfat . In the theory of partial functions, it is a common case that ` F ` is not defined at ` A `. Although it is very convenient for many theorems on functions and their proofs, there are some cases in which from ` ( F `` A ) = (/) ` alone it cannot be decided/derived whether ` ( F `` A ) ` is meaningful ( ` F ` is actually a function which is defined for ` A ` and really has the function value ` (/) ` at ` A ` ) or not. Therefore, additional assumptions are required, such as ` (/) e/ ran F ` , ` (/) e. ran F `, ` F defAt A ` or ` Fun F /\\ A e. dom F ` (see, for example, ~ ndmfvrcl ). To avoid such an ambiguity, an alternative definition ` ( F '''' A ) ` (see ~ df-afv2 ) would be possible which evaluates to a set not belonging to the range of ` F ` ( ` ( F '''' A ) = ~P U. ran F ` ) if it is not meaningful (see ~ ndfatafv2 ). We say \"` ( F '''' A ) ` is not defined (or undefined)\" if ` ( F '''' A ) ` is not in the range of ` F ` (` ( F '''' A ) e/ ran F `). Because of ~ afv2ndefb , this is equivalent to ` ( ( F '''' A ) = ` ` ~P U. ran F `. If ` ( F '''' A ) ` is in the range of ` F ` (` ( F '''' A ) e. ran F `), we say that \"` ( F '''' A ) ` is defined\". If ` ran F ` is a set, we can use the symbol ` Undef ` to express that ` ( F '''' A ) ` is not defined: ` ( F '''' A ) = ( Undef `` ran F ) ` (see ~ ndfatafv2undef ). We could have used this symbol directly to define the alternate value of a function, which would have the advantage that ` ( F '''' A ) ` would always be a set. But first this symbol is defined using the original function value, which would not make it possible to replace the original definition by the alternate definition, and second we would have to assume that ` ran F e. _V ` in most of the theorems. To summarize, that means ` ( F '''' A ) e/ ran F -> ( F `` A ) = (/) ` (see ~ afv2ndeffv0 ), but ` ( F `` A ) = (/) -> ( F '''' A ) e/ ran F ` is not generally valid, see ~ afv2fv0 . The alternate definition, however, corresponds to the current definition (` ( F `` A ) = ( F '''' A ) ` ) if the function ` F ` is defined at ` A ` (see ~ dfatafv2eqfv ). With this definition the following intuitive equivalence holds: ` ( F defAt A <-> ( F '''' A ) e. ran F ) `, see ~ dfatafv2rnb . An interesting question would be if ` ( F `` A ) ` could be replaced by ` ( F ''' A ) ` in most of the theorems based on function values. If we look at the (currently 24) proofs using the definition ~ df-fv of ` ( F `` A ) `, we see that analogues for the following 7 theorems can be proven using the alternative definition: ~ fveq1 -> ~ afv2eq1 , ~ fveq2 -> ~ afv2eq2 , ~ nffv -> ~ nfafv2 , ~ csbfv12 -> csbafv212g , ~ rlimdm -> ~ rlimdmafv2 , ~ tz6.12-1 -> ~ tz6.12-1-afv2 , ~ fveu -> ~ afv2eu . Six theorems proved by directly using ~ df-fv are within a mathbox ( ~ fvsb , ~ uncov ) or not used ( ~ rlimdmafv , ~ avril1 ) or experimental ( ~ dfafv2 , ~ dfafv22 ). However, the remaining 11 theorems proved by directly using ~ df-fv are used more or less often: * ~ fvex : used in about 1600 proofs: Only if the function is defined at the argument, or the range of the function/class is a set, analog theorems can be proven ( ~ dfatafv2ex resp. ~ afv2ex ). All of these 1600 proofs have to be checked if one of these two theorems can be used instead of ~ fvex . * ~ fvres : used in about 400 proofs : Only if the function is defined at the argument, an analog theorem can be proven ( ~ afv2res ). In the undefined case such a theorem cannot exist (without additional assumtions), because the range of ` ( F |`` B ) ` is mostly different from the range of ` F `, and therefore also the \"undefined\" values are different. All of these 400 proofs have to be checked if ~ afv2res can be used instead of ~ fvres . * ~ tz6.12-2 (-> ~ tz6.12-2-afv2 ): root theorem of many theorems which have not a strict analogue, and which are used many times: ** ~ fvprc (-> ~ afv2prc ), used in 193 proofs, ** ~ tz6.12i (-> ~ tz6.12i-afv2 ), used - indirectly via ~ fvbr0 and ~ fvrn0 - in 19 proofs, and in ~ fvclss used in ~ fvclex used in ~ fvresex (which is not used!) and in ~ dcomex (used in 4 proofs), ** ~ ndmfv (-> ndmafv2nrn ), used in 124 proofs ** ~ nfunsn (-> nfunsnafv2 ), used by ~ fvfundmfvn0 (used in 3 proofs), and ~ dffv2 (not used) ** ~ funpartfv , ~ setrec2lem1 (mathboxes) * ~ fv2 : only used by ~ elfv , which is only used by ~ fv3 , which is not used. * ~ dffv3 (-> dfafv23 ): used by ~ dffv4 (the previous \"df-fv\"), which now is only used in mathboxes ( ~ csbfv12gALTVD ), by ~ shftval (itself used in 11 proofs), by ~ dffv5 (mathbox) and by ~ fvco2 (-> ~ afv2co2 ). * ~ fvopab5 : used only by ~ ajval (not used) and by ~ adjval , which is used in ~ adjval2 (not used) and in ~ adjbdln (used in 7 proofs). * ~ zsum : used (via ~ isum , ~ sum0 , ~ sumss and ~ fsumsers ) in 76 proofs. * ~ isumshft : used in ~ pserdv2 (used in ~ logtayl , ~ binomcxplemdvsum ) , ~ eftlub (used in 4 proofs), ~ binomcxplemnotnn0 (used in ~ binomcxp only) and ~ logtayl (used in 4 proofs). * ~ ovtpos : used in 16 proofs. * ~ zprod : used in 3 proofs: ~ iprod , ~ zprodn0 and ~ prodss * ~ iprodclim3 : not used! As a result of this analysis we can say that the current definition of a function value is crucial for Metamath and cannot be exchanged easily with an alternative definition. While ~ fv2 , ~ dffv3 , ~ fvopab5 , ~ zsum , ~ isumshft , ~ ovtpos and ~ zprod are not critical or are, hopefully, also valid for the alternative definition, ~ fvex , ~ fvres and ~ tz6.12-2 (and the theorems based on them) are essential for the current definition of function values.","blocks":[{"name":"cafv2","content":"Extend the definition of a class to include the alternate function value.
