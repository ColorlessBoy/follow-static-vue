{"index":714,"title":"Closed walks as words","content":"In general, a closed walk is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, as defined in ~ df-clwlks : p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n), with p(n) = p(0). Often, it is sufficient to refer to a walk by the (cyclic) sequence of its vertices, i.e omitting its edges in its representation: p(0) p(1) ... p(n-1) p(0), see the corresponding remark on cycles (which are special closed walks) in [Diestel] p. 7. As for \"walks as words\" in general, the concept of a ` Word `, see ~ df-word , is also used in definitions ~ df-clwwlk and ~ df-clwwlkn , and the representation of a closed walk as the sequence of its vertices is called \"closed walk as word\". In contrast to \"walks as words\", the terminating vertex p(n) of a closed walk is omitted in the representation of a closed walk as word, see definitions ~ df-clwwlk , ~ df-clwwlkn and ~ df-clwwlknon , because it is always equal to the first vertex of the closed walk. This represenation has the advantage that the vertices can be cyclically shifted without changing the represented closed walk. Furthermore, the length of a closed walk (i.e. the number of its edges) equals the number of symbols/vertices of the word representing the closed walk. To avoid to handle the degenerate case of representing a (closed) walk of length 0 by the empty word, this case is excluded within the definition (` w =/= (/) `). This is because a walk of length 0 is anchored at an arbitrary vertex by the general definition for closed walks, see ~ 0clwlkv , which neither can be reflected by the empty word nor by a singleton word ` <\" v \"> ` with vertex v : ` <\" v \"> ` represents the walk \"` v ` ` v `\", which is a (closed) walk of length 1 (if there is an edge/loop from ` v ` to ` v `), see ~ loopclwwlkn1b . Therefore, a closed walk corresponds to a closed walk as word only for walks of length at least 1, see ~ clwlkclwwlk2 or ~ clwlkclwwlken . Although the set ` ClWWalksN ` of all closed walks of a fixed length as words over the set of vertices is defined as function over ` NN0 `, the fixed length is usually not 0, because ` ( 0 ClWWalksN G ) = (/) ` (see ~ clwwlkn0 ). Analogous to ` ( A ( N WWalksNOn G ) B ) `, the set of walks of a fixed length ` N ` between two vertices ` A ` and ` B `, the set ` ( X ( ClWWalksNOn `` G ) N ) ` of closed walks of a fixed length ` N ` anchored at a fixed vertex ` X ` is defined by ~ df-clwwlknon . This definition is also based on ` NN0 ` instead of ` NN `, with ` ( X ( ClWWalksNOn `` G ) 0 ) = (/) ` (see ~ clwwlk0on0 ). ~ clwwlknon1le1 states that there is at most one (closed) walk of length ` 1 ` on a vertex, which would consist of a loop (see ~ clwwlknon1loop ). And in a ` K `-regular graph, there are ` K ` closed walks of length ` 2 ` on each vertex, see ~ clwwlknon2num .","blocks":[]}
