The symbol used to represent this function is sometimes the variant greek letter theta shown here and sometimes the greek letter psi, &psi;; however, this notation can also refer to the second Chebyshev function, which adds up the logarithms of prime powers instead, see ~ df-chp . See ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_function for a discussion of the two functions. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 15-Sep-2014.)","parent":[],"children":["chtf","chtval"]}
