Here we simply define it as the splitting field of a dense sequence of polynomials (using as the ` n ` -th set the collection of polynomials with degree less than ` n ` and with coefficients ` < ( p ^ n ) ` ). Krasner's lemma will then show that all monic polynomials have splitting fields isomorphic to a sufficiently close Eisenstein polynomial from the list, and unramified extensions are generated by the polynomial ` x ^ ( p ^ n ) - x ` , which is in the list. Thus, every finite extension of ` Qp ` is a subfield of this field extension, so it is algebraically closed. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 2-Dec-2014.)","parent":[],"children":[""]}
