Those inexperienced with formal notations of classical logic may use expressions combining \"there exists\" with implication. This is usually a mistake, because that combination does not mean what an inexperienced person might think it means. For example, if there is some object that does not meet the precondition ` ph ` , then the expression ` E. x ( ph -> ps ) ` as a whole is always true, no matter what ` ps ` is ( ` ps ` could even be false, ` F. ` ). New users of formal notation who use \"there exists\" with an implication should consider if they meant \"and\" instead of \"implies\". See ~ eximp-surprise , which shows what implication really expands to. See also ~ empty-surprise . (Contributed by David A.
