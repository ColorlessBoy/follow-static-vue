Copy of ~ luk-2 or ~ pm2.18 , but introduced as an axiom. The core idea behind this axiom is, that if something can be implied from both an antecedent, and separately from its negation, then the antecedent is irrelevant to the consequent, and can safely be dropped. This is perhaps better seen from the following slightly extended version (related to ~ pm2.65 ): ` ( ( ph -> ph ) -> ( ( -. ph -> ph ) -> ph ) ) ` . (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 17-Dec-2018.)
