By this definition, the closure law is expressed as binary relation: a binary operation is related to a set by ` clLaw ` if the closure law holds for this binary operation regarding this set. Note that the binary operation needs not to be a function. (Contributed by AV, 7-Jan-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["iscllaw","clcllaw"]}
