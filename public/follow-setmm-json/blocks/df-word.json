A word (sometimes also called a _string_) is a finite sequence of symbols from a set (alphabet) ` S ` . Definition in Section 9.1 of [AhoHopUll] p. 318. The domain is forced to be an initial segment of ` NN0 ` so that two words with the same symbols in the same order be equal. The set ` Word S ` is sometimes denoted by S*, using the Kleene star, although the Kleene star, or Kleene closure, is sometimes reserved to denote an operation on languages. The set ` Word S ` is the free monoid over ` S ` , where the monoid law is concatenation and the monoid unit is the empty word (see ~ frmdval ). (Contributed by FL, 14-Jan-2014.)
