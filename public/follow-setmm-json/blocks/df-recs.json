See ~ df-rdg for more details on why this definition is desirable. Unlike ~ df-rdg which restricts the update rule to use only the previous value, this version allows the update rule to use _all_ previous values, which is why it is described as \"strong\", although it is actually more primitive. See ~ recsfnon and ~ recsval for the primary contract of this definition. (Contributed by Stefan O'Rear, 18-Jan-2015.)
