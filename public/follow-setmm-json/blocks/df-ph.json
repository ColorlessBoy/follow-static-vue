An inner product space is a normed vector space whose norm satisfies the parallelogram law (a property that induces an inner product). Based on Exercise 4(b) of [ReedSimon] p. 63. The vector operation is ` g ` , the scalar product is ` s ` , and the norm is ` n ` . An inner product space is also called a pre-Hilbert space. (Contributed by NM, 2-Apr-2007.)
