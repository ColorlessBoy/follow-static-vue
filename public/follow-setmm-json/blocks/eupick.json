If there is only one thing ` x ` such that ` ph ` is true, and there is also an ` x ` (actually the same one) such that ` ph ` and ` ps ` are both true, then ` ph ` implies ` ps ` regardless of ` x ` . This theorem can be useful for eliminating existential quantifiers in a hypothesis. Compare Theorem *14.26 in [WhiteheadRussell] p. 192.
