Definition 1 of [BourbakiAlg1] p. 1, or definition of a groupoid in section I.1 of [Bruck] p. 1. Note: The term \"groupoid\" is now widely used to refer to other objects: (small) categories all of whose morphisms are invertible, or groups with a partial function replacing the binary operation. Therefore, we will only use the term \"magma\" for the present notion in set.mm. (Contributed by AV, 6-Jan-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["ismgmALT"]}
