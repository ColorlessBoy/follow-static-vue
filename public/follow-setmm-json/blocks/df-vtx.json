This definition is very general: It defines the set of vertices for any ordered pair as its first component, and for any other class as its \"base set\". It is meaningful, however, only if the ordered pair represents a graph resp. the class is an extensible structure representing a graph. (Contributed by AV, 9-Jan-2020.)
