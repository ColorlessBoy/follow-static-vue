This definition is based on Leibniz' Formula (see ~ mdetleib ). The properties of the axiomatic definition of a determinant according to [Weierstrass] p. 272 are derived from this definition as theorems: \"The determinant function is the unique multilinear, alternating and normalized function from the algebra of square matrices of the same dimension over a commutative ring to this ring\". The functionality is shown by ~ mdetf . Multilineary means \"linear for each row\" - the additivity is shown by ~ mdetrlin , the homogeneity by ~ mdetrsca . Furthermore, it is shown that the determinant function is alternating (see ~ mdetralt ) and normalized (see ~ mdet1 ). Finally, the uniqueness is shown by ~ mdetuni . As a consequence, the \"determinant of a square matrix\" is the function value of the determinant function for this square matrix, see ~ mdetleib . (Contributed by Stefan O'Rear, 9-Sep-2015.)
