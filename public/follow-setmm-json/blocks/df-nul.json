More precisely, we should write \"empty class\". It will be posited in ~ ax-nul that an empty set exists. Then, by uniqueness among classes ( ~ eq0 , as opposed to the weaker uniqueness among sets, ~ nulmo ), it will follow that ` (/) ` is indeed a set ( ~ 0ex ). Special case of Exercise 4.10(o) of [Mendelson] p. 231. For a more traditional definition, but requiring a dummy variable, see ~ dfnul2 . (Contributed by NM, 17-Jun-1993.)
