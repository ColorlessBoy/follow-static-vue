For every set ` x ` there is an inaccessible cardinal ` y ` such that ` y ` is not in ` x ` . The addition of this axiom to ZFC set theory provides a framework for category theory, thus for all practical purposes giving us a complete foundation for \"all of mathematics.\" This version of the axiom is used by the Mizar project ( ~ http://www.mizar.org/JFM/Axiomatics/tarski.html ). Unlike the ZFC axioms, this axiom is very long when expressed in terms of primitive symbols - see ~ grothprim . An open problem is finding a shorter equivalent.
