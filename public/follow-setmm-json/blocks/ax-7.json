One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality. It states that equality is a right-Euclidean binary relation (this is similar, but not identical, to being transitive, which is proved as ~ equtr ). This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation. Also appears as Axiom C7 of [Monk2] p. 105 and Axiom Scheme C8' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). The equality symbol was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde. He chose a pair of parallel lines of the same length because \"noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle\". We prove in ~ ax7 that this axiom can be recovered from its weakened version ~ ax7v where ` x ` and ` y ` are assumed to be disjoint variables. In particular, the only theorem referencing ~ ax-7 should be ~ ax7v . See the comment of ~ ax7v for more details on these matters. (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.) (Revised by BJ, 7-Dec-2020.) Use ~ ax7 instead. (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax7v"]}
