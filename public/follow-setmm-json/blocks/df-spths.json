According to Wikipedia (\"Path (graph theory)\", ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) , 3-Oct-2017): \"A path is a trail in which all vertices (except possibly the first and last) are distinct. ... use the term simple path to refer to a path which contains no repeated vertices.\" Therefore, a simple path can be represented by an injective mapping f from { 1 , ... , n } and an injective mapping p from { 0 , ... , n }, where f enumerates the (indices of the) different edges, and p enumerates the vertices. So the simple path is also represented by the following sequence: p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n). (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 20-Oct-2017.)
