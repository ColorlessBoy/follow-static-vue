No ` ph ` is ` ps ` , and some ` ch ` is ` ph ` , therefore some ` ch ` is not ` ps ` . Instance of ~ darii . In Aristotelian notation, EIO-1: MeP and SiM therefore SoP. For example, given \"No homework is fun\" and \"Some reading is homework\", therefore \"Some reading is not fun\". This is essentially a logical axiom in Aristotelian logic.
