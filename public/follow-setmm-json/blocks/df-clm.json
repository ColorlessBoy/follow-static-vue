Since the field of complex numbers is commutative and so are its subrings (see ~ subrgcrng ), left modules over such subrings are the same as right modules, see ~ rmodislmod . Therefore, we drop the word \"left\" from \"subcomplex left module\". (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 16-Oct-2015.)","parent":[],"children":["isclm"]}
