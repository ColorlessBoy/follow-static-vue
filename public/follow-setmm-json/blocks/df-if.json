The expression ` if ( ph , A , B ) ` is read \"if ` ph ` then ` A ` else ` B ` \". See ~ iftrue and ~ iffalse for its values. In the mathematical literature, this operator is rarely defined formally but is implicit in informal definitions such as \"let f(x)=0 if x=0 and 1/x otherwise\". An important use for us is in conjunction with the weak deduction theorem, which is described in the next section, beginning at ~ dedth .
