Definition 4.4 of [Schwabhauser] p. 35. A \"shape\" is a finite sequence of points, and a triangle can be represented as a shape with three points. Two shapes are congruent if all corresponding segments between all corresponding points are congruent. Many systems of geometry define triangle congruence as requiring both segment congruence and angle congruence. Such systems, such as Hilbert's axiomatic system, typically have a primitive notion of angle congruence in addition to segment congruence. Here, angle congruence is instead a derived notion, defined later in ~ df-cgra and expanded in ~ iscgra . This does not mean our system is weaker; ~ dfcgrg2 proves that these two definitions are equivalent, and using the Tarski definition instead (given in [Schwabhauser] p. 35) is simpler. Once two triangles are proven congruent as defined here, you can use various theorems to prove that corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent (CPCTC). For example, see ~ cgr3simp1 , ~ cgr3simp2 , ~ cgr3simp3 , ~ cgrcgra , and permutation laws such as ~ cgr3swap12 and ~ dfcgrg2 . Ideally, we would define this for functions of any set, but we will use words (see ~ df-word ) in most cases. (Contributed by Thierry Arnoux, 3-Apr-2019.)","parent":[],"children":["iscgrg","ercgrg"]}
