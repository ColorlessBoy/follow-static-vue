Our notation is not standard. A formal notation doesn't seem to exist in the literature; instead only informal English tends to be used. The present definition, although somewhat cryptic, nicely avoids dummy variables. In ~ dfer2 we derive a more typical definition. We show that an equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive in ~ erref , ~ ersymb , and ~ ertr . (Contributed by NM, 4-Jun-1995.)
