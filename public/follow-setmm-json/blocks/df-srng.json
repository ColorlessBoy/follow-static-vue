A star ring is a ring with an involution (conjugation) function. Involution (unlike say the ring zero) is not unique and therefore must be added as a new component to the ring. For example, two possible involutions for complex numbers are the identity function and complex conjugation. Definition of involution in [Holland95] p. 204. (Contributed by NM, 22-Sep-2011.)
