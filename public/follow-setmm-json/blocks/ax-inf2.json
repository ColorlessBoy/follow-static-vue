In English, it says: there exists a set that contains the empty set and the successors of all of its members. Theorem ~ zfinf2 shows it converted to abbreviations. This axiom was derived as theorem ~ axinf2 above, using our version of Infinity ~ ax-inf and the Axiom of Regularity ~ ax-reg . We will reference ~ ax-inf2 instead of ~ axinf2 so that the ordinary uses of Regularity can be more easily identified. The reverse derivation of ~ ax-inf from ~ ax-inf2 is shown by theorem ~ axinf .
