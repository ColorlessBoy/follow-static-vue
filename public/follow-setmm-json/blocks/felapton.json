No ` ph ` is ` ps ` , all ` ph ` is ` ch ` , and some ` ph ` exist, therefore some ` ch ` is not ` ps ` . Instance of ~ darapti . In Aristotelian notation, EAO-3: MeP and MaS therefore SoP. For example, \"No flowers are animals\" and \"All flowers are plants\", therefore \"Some plants are not animals\". (Contributed by David A.
