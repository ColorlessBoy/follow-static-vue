This is also sometimes called the \"cross product\" but that term also has other meanings; we intentionally choose a less ambiguous term. Definition 9.11 of [Quine] p. 64. For example, ` ( { 1 , 5 } X. { 2 , 7 } ) = ` ` ( { <. 1 , 2 >. , <. 1 , 7 >. } u. { <. 5 , 2 >. , <. 5 , 7 >. } ) ` ( ~ ex-xp ). Another example is that the set of rational numbers are defined in ~ df-q using the Cartesian product ` ( ZZ X. NN ) ` ; the left- and right-hand sides of the Cartesian product represent the top (integer) and bottom (natural) numbers of a fraction.
