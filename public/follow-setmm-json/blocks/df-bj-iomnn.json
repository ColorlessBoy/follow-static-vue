To understand this definition, recall that set.mm constructs reals as couples whose first component is a prereal and second component is the zero prereal (in order that one have ` RR C_ CC ` ), that prereals are equivalence classes of couples of positive reals, the latter are Dedekind cuts of positive rationals, which are equivalence classes of positive ordinals. In partiular, we take the successor ordinal at the beginning and subtract one at the end since the intermediate systems contain only (strictly) positive numbers. Note the similarity with ~ df-bj-fractemp but we did not use the present definition there since we wanted to have defined ` pinfty ` first. See ~ bj-iomnnom for its value at ` pinfty ` . TODO: define ` |- NN0 = ( iomnn \" _om ) ` (and then ` |- NN = ( NN0 \\ NN ) ` ) and prove ` |- ( iomnn |`` _om ) : _om -1-1-onto-> NN0 ` and that this bijection is an ordered rig isomorphism. Prove ` |- ( iomnn |`` _om ) = rec ( ( x e. RR |-> ( x + 1 ) ) , 0 ) ` and ` |- ( iomnn `` (/) ) = 0 ` . (Contributed by BJ, 18-Feb-2023.) The precise definition is irrelevant and should generally not be used. (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["bj-iomnnom"]}
