Alternatively, I start from Jan Lukasiewicz's axiom system here, i.e. ~ ax-mp , ~ ax-luk1 , ~ ax-luk2 and ~ ax-luk3 . I rather copy this system than use ~ luk-1 to ~ luk-3 , since the latter are theorems, while we need axioms here. (Contributed by Wolf Lammen, 23-Feb-2018.) (New usage is discouraged.)
