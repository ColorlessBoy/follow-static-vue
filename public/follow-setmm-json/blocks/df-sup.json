It is meaningful when ` R ` is a relation that strictly orders ` B ` and when the supremum exists. For example, ` R ` could be 'less than', ` B ` could be the set of real numbers, and ` A ` could be the set of all positive reals whose square is less than 2; in this case the supremum is defined as the square root of 2 per ~ sqrtval . See ~ dfsup2 for alternate definition not requiring dummy variables.
