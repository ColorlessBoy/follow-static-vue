This is practically ~ dfrefrels2 (which reveals that ` RefRels ` can not include proper classes like ` _I ` as is elements, see comments of ~ dfrefrels2 ). Another alternative definition is ~ dfrefrels3 . The element of this class and the reflexive relation predicate ( ~ df-refrel ) are the same, that is, ` ( R e. RefRels <-> RefRel R ) ` when ` A ` is a set, see ~ elrefrelsrel . This definition is similar to the definitions of the classes of symmetric ( ~ df-symrels ) and transitive ( ~ df-trrels ) relations.
