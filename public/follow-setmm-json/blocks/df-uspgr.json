An undirected simple pseudograph is a special undirected pseudograph (see ~ uspgrupgr ) or a special undirected simple hypergraph (see ~ uspgrushgr ), consisting of a set ` v ` (of \"vertices\") and an injective (one-to-one) function ` e ` (representing (indexed) \"edges\") into subsets of ` v ` of cardinality one or two, representing the two vertices incident to the edge, or the one vertex if the edge is a loop. In contrast to a pseudograph, there is at most one edge between two vertices resp. at most one loop for a vertex. (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 10-Aug-2017.)
