We define it this way for ~ cmpt , which requires the form ` ( x e. A |-> B ) ` . See ~ sinhval-named for a simple way to evaluate it. We define this function by dividing by ` _i ` , which uses fewer operations than many conventional definitions (and thus is more convenient to use in set.mm). See ~ sinh-conventional for a justification that our definition is the same as the conventional definition of sinh used in other sources. (Contributed by David A.
