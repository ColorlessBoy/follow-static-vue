A partial function from ` B ` to ` A ` is a function from a subset of ` B ` to ` A ` . The set of all partial functions from ` B ` to ` A ` is written ` ( A ^pm B ) ` (see ~ pmvalg ). A notation for this operation apparently does not appear in the literature. We use ` ^pm ` to distinguish it from the less general set exponentiation operation ` ^m ` ( ~ df-map ). See ~ mapsspm for its relationship to set exponentiation. (Contributed by NM, 15-Nov-2007.)","parent":[],"children":["fnpm","pmvalg"]}
