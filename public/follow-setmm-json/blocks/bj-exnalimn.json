The general statement that ~ equs3OLD proves. This and the following theorems are the general instances of already proved theorems. They could be moved to the main part, before ~ ax-5 . I propose to move to the main part: ~ bj-exnalimn , ~ bj-exalim , ~ bj-exalimi , ~ bj-exalims , ~ bj-exalimsi , ~ bj-ax12i , ~ bj-ax12wlem , ~ bj-ax12w , and remove ~ equs3OLD . A new label is needed for ~ bj-ax12i and label suggestions are welcome for the others. I also propose to change ` -. A. x -. ` to ` E. x ` in ~ speimfw and ~ spimfw (other spim* theorems use ` E. x ` and very few theorems in set.mm use ` -. A. x -. ` ).
