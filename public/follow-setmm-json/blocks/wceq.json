For a general discussion of the theory of classes, see ~ mmset.html#class . (The purpose of introducing ` wff A = B ` here, and not in set theory where it belongs, is to allow us to express, i.e., \"prove\", the ~ weq of predicate calculus in terms of the ~ wceq of set theory, so that we do not \"overload\" the ` = ` connective with two syntax definitions. This is done to prevent ambiguity that would complicate some Metamath parsers. For example, some parsers - although not the Metamath program - stumble on the fact that the ` = ` in ` x = y ` could be the ` = ` of either ~ weq or ~ wceq , although mathematically it makes no difference. The class variables ` A ` and ` B ` are introduced temporarily for the purpose of this definition but otherwise not used in predicate calculus. See ~ df-cleq for more information on the set theory usage of ~ wceq .)","parent":[],"children":[]}
