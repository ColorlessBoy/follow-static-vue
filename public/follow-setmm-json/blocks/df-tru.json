In this definition, an instance of ~ id is used as the definiens, although any tautology, such as an axiom, can be used in its place. This particular instance of ~ id was chosen so this definition can be checked by the same algorithm that is used for predicate calculus. This definition should be referenced directly only by ~ tru , and other proofs should use ~ tru instead of this definition, since there are many alternate ways to define ` T. ` .
