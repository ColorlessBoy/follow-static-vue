The cardinal number of a set is the least ordinal number equinumerous to it. In other words, it is the \"size\" of the set. Definition of [Enderton] p. 197. See ~ cardval for its value and ~ cardval2 for a simpler version of its value. The principal theorem relating cardinality to equinumerosity is ~ carden . Our notation is from Enderton. Other textbooks often use a double bar over the set to express this function. (Contributed by NM, 21-Oct-2003.)","parent":[],"children":["cardf2","cardval3"]}
