This class can be thought of as the \"smallest\" class containing all elements of ` A ` that are linked to ` X ` by a chain of ` R ` relationships (see ~ trpredtr and ~ trpredmintr ). Definition based off of Lemma 4.2 of Don Monk's notes for Advanced Set Theory, which can be found at ~ http://euclid.colorado.edu/~~monkd/settheory (check The Internet Archive for it now as Prof. Monk appears to have rewritten his website).
