The only axiom of predicate calculus requiring that variables be distinct (if we consider ~ ax-5 to be a metatheorem and not an axiom). Axiom scheme C16' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It apparently does not otherwise appear in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by cases. It is a somewhat bizarre axiom since the antecedent is always false in set theory (see ~ dtru ), but nonetheless it is technically necessary as you can see from its uses. This axiom is redundant if we include ~ ax-5 ; see theorem ~ axc16 . Alternately, ~ ax-5 becomes logically redundant in the presence of this axiom, but without ~ ax-5 we lose the more powerful metalogic that results from being able to express the concept of a setvar variable not occurring in a wff (as opposed to just two setvar variables being distinct). We retain ~ ax-c16 here to provide logical completeness for systems with the simpler metalogic that results from omitting ~ ax-5 , which might be easier to study for some theoretical purposes. This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used. It is proved above as theorem ~ axc16 . (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.)
