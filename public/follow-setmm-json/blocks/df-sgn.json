We do not call it \"sign\", which is homophonic with \"sine\" ( ~ df-sin ). Defined as \"sgn\" in ISO 80000-2:2009(E) operation 2-9.13. It is named \"sign\" (with the same definition) in the \"NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions\" , front introduction, \"Common Notations and Definitions\" section at ~ http://dlmf.nist.gov/front/introduction#Sx4 . We define this over ` RR* ` ( ~ df-xr ) instead of ` RR ` so that it can accept ` +oo ` and ` -oo ` . Note that ~ df-psgn defines the sign of a permutation, which is different. Value shown in ~ sgnval . (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 15-May-2015.)","parent":[],"children":["sgnval"]}
