See ~ flval for its value, ~ fllelt for its basic property, and ~ flcl for its closure. For example, ` ( |_ `` ( 3 / 2 ) ) = 1 ` while ` ( |_ `` -u ( 3 / 2 ) ) = -u 2 ` ( ~ ex-fl ). The term \"floor\" was coined by Ken Iverson. He also invented a mathematical notation for floor, consisting of an L-shaped left bracket and its reflection as a right bracket. In APL, the left-bracket alone is used, and we borrow this idea. (Thanks to Paul Chapman for this information.) (Contributed by NM, 14-Nov-2004.)","parent":[],"children":["flval"]}
