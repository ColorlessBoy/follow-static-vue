The Metamath line-for-line translation of this natural deduction approach precedes every line with an antecedent including ` ph ` and uses the Metamath equivalents of the natural deduction rules. Below is the final Metamath proof (which reorders some steps). A much more efficient proof, using more of Metamath and MPE's capabilities, is shown in ~ ex-natded5.2-2 . A proof without context is shown in ~ ex-natded5.2i . (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 9-Feb-2017.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)
