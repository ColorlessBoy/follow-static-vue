A function ` f ` is uniformly continuous if, roughly speaking, it is possible to guarantee that ` ( f `` x ) ` and ` ( f `` y ) ` be as close to each other as we please by requiring only that ` x ` and ` y ` are sufficiently close to each other; unlike ordinary continuity, the maximum distance between ` ( f `` x ) ` and ` ( f `` y ) ` cannot depend on ` x ` and ` y ` themselves. This formulation is the definition 1 of [BourbakiTop1] p. II.6. (Contributed by Thierry Arnoux, 16-Nov-2017.)","parent":[],"children":["ucnval"]}
