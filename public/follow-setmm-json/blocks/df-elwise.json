For instance, ` + ` is the addition of complex numbers ( ~ axaddf ), so if ` A ` and ` B ` are sets of complex numbers, then ` ( A ( elwise `` + ) B ) ` is the set of numbers of the form ` ( x + y ) ` with ` x e. A ` and ` y e. B ` . The set of odd natural numbers is ` ( ( { 2 } ( elwise `` x. ) NN0 ) ( elwise `` + ) { 1 } ) ` , or less formally ` 2 NN0 + 1 ` .
