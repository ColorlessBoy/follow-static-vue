Note on the various syllogism-like statements in set.mm. The hypothetical syllogism ~ syl infers an implication from two implications (and there are ~ 3syl and ~ 4syl for chaining more inferences). There are four inferences inferring an implication from one implication and one biconditional: ~ sylbi , ~ sylib , ~ sylbir , ~ sylibr ; four inferences inferring an implication from two biconditionals: ~ sylbb , ~ sylbbr , ~ sylbb1 , ~ sylbb2 ; four inferences inferring a biconditional from two biconditionals: ~ bitri , ~ bitr2i , ~ bitr3i , ~ bitr4i (and more for chaining more biconditionals). There are also closed forms and deduction versions of these, like, among many others, ~ syld , ~ syl5 , ~ syl6 , ~ mpbid , ~ bitrd , ~ syl5bb , ~ syl6bb and variants.
