For example, ` ( #p `` 1 0 ) = 2 x. 3 x. 5 x. 7 = 2 1 0 ` (see ~ ex-prmo ). In the literature, the primorial function is written as a postscript hash: 6# = 30. In contrast to ~ prmorcht , where the primorial function is defined by using the sequence builder ( ` P = seq 1 ( x. , F ) ` ), the more specialized definition of a product of a series is used here.
