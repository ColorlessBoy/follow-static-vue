For a general discussion of the theory of classes, see ~ mmset.html#class . (The purpose of introducing ` wff A e.

This is done to prevent ambiguity that would complicate some Metamath parsers. The class variables ` A ` and ` B ` are introduced temporarily for the purpose of this definition but otherwise not used in predicate calculus. See ~ df-clab for more information on the set theory usage of ~ wcel .)","parent":[],"children":[]}
