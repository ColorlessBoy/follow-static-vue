Those inexperienced with formal notations of classical logic may use expressions combining \"there exists\" with implication. That is usually a mistake, because as proven using ~ imor , such an expression can be rewritten using _not_ with _or_ - and that is often not what the author intended. New users of formal notation who use \"there exists\" with an implication should consider if they meant \"and\" instead of \"implies\". A stark example is shown in ~ eximp-surprise2 .
