Such a word corresponds to the sequence p(0) p(1) ... p(n-1) of the vertices in a closed walk p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n)=p(0) as defined in ~ df-clwlks . Notice that the word does not contain the terminating vertex p(n) of the walk, because it is always equal to the first vertex of the closed walk.
