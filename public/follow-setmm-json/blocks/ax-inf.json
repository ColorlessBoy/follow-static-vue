An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. This axiom is the gateway to \"Cantor's paradise\" (an expression coined by Hilbert). It asserts that given a starting set ` x ` , an infinite set ` y ` built from it exists. Although our version is apparently not given in the literature, it is similar to, but slightly shorter than, the Axiom of Infinity in [FreydScedrov] p. 283 (see ~ inf1 and ~ inf2 ). More standard versions, which essentially state that there exists a set containing all the natural numbers, are shown as ~ zfinf2 and ~ omex and are based on the (nontrivial) proof of ~ inf3 . This version has the advantage that when expanded to primitives, it has fewer symbols than the standard version ~ ax-inf2 . Theorem ~ inf0 shows the reverse derivation of our axiom from a standard one. Theorem ~ inf5 shows a very short way to state this axiom. The standard version of Infinity ~ ax-inf2 requires this axiom along with Regularity ~ ax-reg for its derivation (as theorem ~ axinf2 below). In order to more easily identify the normal uses of Regularity, we will usually reference ~ ax-inf2 instead of this one. The derivation of this axiom from ~ ax-inf2 is shown by theorem ~ axinf . Proofs should normally use the standard version ~ ax-inf2 instead of this axiom. (New usage is discouraged.) (Contributed by NM, 16-Aug-1993.)","parent":[],"children":["zfinf"]}
