Note that the definition is arbitrary, requiring only that ` +oo ` be a set not in ` RR ` and different from ` -oo ` ( ~ df-mnf ). We use ` ~P U. CC ` to make it independent of the construction of ` CC ` , and Cantor's Theorem will show that it is different from any member of ` CC ` and therefore ` RR ` . See ~ pnfnre , ~ mnfnre , and ~ pnfnemnf . A simpler possibility is to define ` +oo ` as ` CC ` and ` -oo ` as ` { CC } ` , but that approach requires the Axiom of Regularity to show that ` +oo ` and ` -oo ` are different from each other and from all members of ` RR ` .
