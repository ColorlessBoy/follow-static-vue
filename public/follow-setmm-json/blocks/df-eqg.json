More precisely, if ` G ` is a group and ` H ` is a subgroup, then ` G ~QG H ` is the equivalence relation on ` G ` associated with the left cosets of ` H ` . A typical application of this definition is the construction of the quotient group (resp. ring) of a group (resp. ring) by a normal subgroup (resp. two-sided ideal).
