For example, ` ( cos `` 0 ) = 1 ` (we prove this in ~ cos0 after we define cosine in ~ df-cos ). Typically, function ` F ` is defined using maps-to notation (see ~ df-mpt and ~ df-mpo ), but this is not required. For example, ` F = { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } -> ( F `` 3 ) = 9 ` ( ~ ex-fv ). Note that ~ df-ov will define two-argument functions using ordered pairs as ` ( A F B ) = ( F `` <. A , B >. ) ` . This particular definition is quite convenient: it can be applied to any class and evaluates to the empty set when it is not meaningful (as shown by ~ ndmfv and ~ fvprc ). The left apostrophe notation originated with Peano and was adopted in Definition *30.01 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 235, Definition 10.11 of [Quine] p. 68, and Definition 6.11 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 26. It means the same thing as the more familiar ` F ( A ) ` notation for a function's value at ` A ` , i.e., \" ` F ` of ` A ` \", but without context-dependent notational ambiguity. Alternate definitions are ~ dffv2 , ~ dffv3 , ~ fv2 , and ~ fv3 (the latter two previously required ` A ` to be a set.) Restricted equivalents that require ` F ` to be a function are shown in ~ funfv and ~ funfv2 . For the familiar definition of function value in terms of ordered pair membership, see ~ funopfvb .
