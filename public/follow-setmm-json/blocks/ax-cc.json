It is clearly a special case of ~ ac5 , but is weak enough that it can be proven using DC (see ~ axcc ). It is, however, strictly stronger than ZF and cannot be proven in ZF. It states that any countable collection of nonempty sets must have a choice function. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 9-Feb-2013.)","parent":[],"children":["axcc2lem","axccdom","axccd"]}
