One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality. This axiom tells us is that at least one thing exists. In this form (not requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be distinct) it was used in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in footnote 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 81.) It is equivalent to axiom scheme C10' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint); the equivalence is established by ~ axc10 and ~ ax6fromc10 . A more convenient form of this axiom is ~ ax6e , which has additional remarks. Raph Levien proved the independence of this axiom from the other logical axioms on 12-Apr-2005. See item 16 at ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html . ~ ax-6 can be proved from the weaker version ~ ax6v requiring that the variables be distinct; see theorem ~ ax6 . ~ ax-6 can also be proved from the Axiom of Separation (in the form that we use that axiom, where free variables are not universally quantified). See theorem ~ ax6vsep . Except by ~ ax6v , this axiom should not be referenced directly. Instead, use theorem ~ ax6 . (Contributed by NM, 10-Jan-1993.)
