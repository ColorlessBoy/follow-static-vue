We assume that a proof exists for ` ph ` when the class variable ` A ` is replaced with a specific class ` B ` . The hypothesis ` ch ` should be assigned to the inference, and the inference hypothesis eliminated with ~ elimhyp . If the inference has other hypotheses with class variable ` A ` , these can be kept by assigning ~ keephyp to them. For more information, see the Weak Deduction Theorem page ~ mmdeduction.html .
