A unital ring is a set equipped with two everywhere-defined internal operations, whose first one is an additive group structure and the second one is a multiplicative monoid structure, and where the addition is left- and right-distributive for the multiplication. Definition 1 in [BourbakiAlg1] p. 92 or definition of a ring with identity in part Preliminaries of [Roman] p. 19. So that the additive structure must be abelian (see ~ ringcom ), care must be taken that in the case of a non-unital ring, the commutativity of addition must be postulated and cannot be proved from the other conditions.
