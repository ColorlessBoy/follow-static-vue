According to Wikipedia (\"Cycle (graph theory)\", ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) , 3-Oct-2017): \"A circuit can be a closed walk allowing repetitions of vertices but not edges\"; according to Wikipedia (\"Glossary of graph theory terms\", ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms, 3-Oct-2017): \"A circuit may refer to ... a trail (a closed tour without repeated edges), ...\". Following Bollobas (\"A trail whose endvertices coincide (a closed trail) is called a circuit.\", see Definition of [Bollobas] p. 5.), a circuit is a closed trail without repeated edges. So the circuit is also represented by the following sequence: p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n)=p(0). (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 3-Oct-2017.)
