This is not useful per se, but is used as a step towards the definition of couples (2-tuples, or ordered pairs). The reason for \"tagging\" the set is so that an m-tuple and an n-tuple be equal only when m = n. Note that with this definition, the 0-tuple is the empty set. New usage is discouraged because the precise definition is generally unimportant compared to the characteristic properties ~ bj-2upleq , ~ bj-2uplth , ~ bj-2uplex , and the properties of the projections (see ~ df-bj-pr1 and ~ df-bj-pr2 ).
