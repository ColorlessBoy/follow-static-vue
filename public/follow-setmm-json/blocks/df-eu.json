This expresses unique existence, or existential uniqueness, which is the conjunction of existence ( ~ df-ex ) and uniqueness ( ~ df-mo ). The expression ` E! x ph ` is read \"there exists exactly one ` x ` such that ` ph ` \" or \"there exists a unique ` x ` such that ` ph ` \". This is also called the \"uniqueness quantifier\" but that expression is also used for the at-most-one quantifier ~ df-mo , therefore we avoid that ambiguous name. Definition 10.1 of [BellMachover] p. 97; also Definition *14.02 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 175. Other possible definitions are given by ~ eu1 , ~ eu2 , ~ eu3v , and ~ eu6 . As for double unique existence, beware that the expression ` E! x E! y ph ` means \"there exists a unique ` x ` such that there exists a unique ` y ` such that ` ph ` \" which is a weaker property than \"there exists exactly one ` x ` and one ` y ` such that ` ph ` \" (see ~ 2eu4 ). (Contributed by NM, 12-Aug-1993.) Make this the definition (which used to be ~ eu6 , while this definition was then proved as ~ dfeu ).
