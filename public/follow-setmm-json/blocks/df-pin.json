For ` n = 0 ` , since this is not well-defined we replace this relation with the path-connectedness relation, so that the ` 0 ` -th homotopy group is the set of path components of ` X ` . (Since the ` 0 ` -th loop space does not have a group operation, neither does the ` 0 ` -th homotopy group, but the rest are genuine groups.)
