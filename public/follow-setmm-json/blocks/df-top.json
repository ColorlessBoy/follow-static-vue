It is a proper class (see ~ topnex ). See ~ istopg and ~ istop2g for the corresponding characterizations, using respectively binary intersections like in this definition and nonempty finite intersections. The final form of the definition is due to Bourbaki (Def. 1 of [BourbakiTop1] p. I.1), while the idea of defining a topology in terms of its open sets is due to Aleksandrov. For the convoluted history of the definitions of these notions, see Gregory H. Moore, _The emergence of open sets, closed sets, and limit points in analysis and topology_, Historia Mathematica 35 (2008) 220--241. (Contributed by NM, 3-Mar-2006.)
