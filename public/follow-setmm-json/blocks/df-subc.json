Like ~ df-subg , this is not actually a collection of categories (as in definition 4.1(a) of [Adamek] p. 48), but only sets which when given operations from the base category (using ~ df-resc ) form a category. All the objects and all the morphisms of the subcategory belong to the supercategory. The identity of an object, the domain and the codomain of a morphism are the same in the subcategory and the supercategory. The composition of the subcategory is a restriction of the composition of the supercategory. (Contributed by FL, 17-Sep-2009.)
