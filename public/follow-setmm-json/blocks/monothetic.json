This theorem, rather trivial in our axiomatization, is (the biconditional form of) a standard axiom for monothetic BCI logic. This is the most general theorem of which ~ trujust is an instance. Relatedly, this would be the justification theorem if the definition of ` T. ` were ~ dftru2 . (Contributed by BJ, 7-Sep-2022.)","parent":["2th","id"],"children":["trujust"]}
