We need ` Disjs ` for the definition of Parts and Part for the Partition-Equivalence Theorems: this need for Parts as disjoint relations on their domain quotients is the reason why we must define ` Disjs ` instead of simply using converse functions (cf. ~ dfdisjALTV ). The element of the class of disjoints and the disjoint predicate are the same, that is ` ( R e. Disjs <-> Disj R ) ` when ` R ` is a set, see ~ eldisjsdisj . Alternate definitions are ~ dfdisjs , ... , ~ dfdisjs5 . (Contributed by Peter Mazsa, 17-Jul-2021.)","parent":[],"children":["dfdisjs"]}
