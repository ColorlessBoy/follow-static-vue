For an extended nonnegative integer s, an s-walk is a sequence of hyperedges, e(0), e(1), ... , e(k), where e(j-1) and e(j) have at least s vertices in common (for j=1, ... , k). In contrast to the definition in Aksoy et al., ` s = 0 ` (a 0-walk is an arbitrary sequence of hyperedges) and ` s = +oo ` (then the number of common vertices of two adjacent hyperedges must be infinite) are allowed. Furthermore, it is not forbidden that adjacent hyperedges are equal. (Contributed by AV, 4-Jan-2021.)","parent":[],"children":["ewlksfval","ewlkprop"]}
