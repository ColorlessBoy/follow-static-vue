According to definition 4 in [Huneke] p. 2: \"A walk of length n on (a graph) G is an ordered sequence v0 , v1 , ... v(n) of vertices such that v(i) and v(i+1) are neighbors (i.e are connected by an edge). We say the walk is closed if v(n) = v0\". According to the definition of a walk as two mappings f from { 0 , ... , ( n - 1 ) } and p from { 0 , ... , n }, where f enumerates the (indices of the) edges, and p enumerates the vertices, a closed walk is represented by the following sequence: p(0) e(f(0)) p(1) e(f(1)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n-1)) p(n)=p(0). Notice that by this definition, a single vertex can be considered as a closed walk of length 0, see also ~ 0clwlk . (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 12-Mar-2018.)
