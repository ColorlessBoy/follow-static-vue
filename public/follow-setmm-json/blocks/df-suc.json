When applied to an ordinal number, the successor means the same thing as \"plus 1\" (see ~ oa1suc ). Definition 7.22 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 41, who use \"+ 1\" to denote this function. Ordinal natural numbers defined using this successor function and 0 as the empty set are also called von Neumann ordinals; 0 is the empty set {}, 1 is {0, {0}}, 2 is {1, {1}}, and so on. Our definition is a generalization to classes. Although it is not conventional to use it with proper classes, it has no effect on a proper class ( ~ sucprc ), so that the successor of any ordinal class is still an ordinal class ( ~ ordsuc ), simplifying certain proofs. Some authors denote the successor operation with a prime (apostrophe-like) symbol, such as Definition 6 of [Suppes] p. 134 and the definition of successor in [Mendelson] p. 246 (who uses the symbol \"Suc\" as a predicate to mean \"is a successor ordinal\"). The definition of successor of [Enderton] p. 68 denotes the operation with a plus-sign superscript.
