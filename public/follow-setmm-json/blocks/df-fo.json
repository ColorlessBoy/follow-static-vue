Definition 6.15(4) of [TakeutiZaring] p. 27. We use their notation (\"onto\" under the arrow). For alternate definitions, see ~ dffo2 , ~ dffo3 , ~ dffo4 , and ~ dffo5 . An onto function is also called a \"surjection\" or a \"surjective function\", ` F : A -onto-> B ` can be read as \" ` F ` is a surjection from ` A ` onto ` B ` \". Surjections are precisely the epimorphisms in the category ` SetCat ` of sets and set functions, see ~ setcepi .
