No ` ph ` is ` ps ` , all ` ch ` is ` ph ` , and some ` ch ` exist, therefore some ` ch ` is not ` ps ` . Instance of ~ barbari . In Aristotelian notation, EAO-1: MeP and SaM therefore SoP. For example, given \"No reptiles have fur\", \"All snakes are reptiles\", and \"Snakes exist\", prove \"Some snakes have no fur\". Note the existence hypothesis.
