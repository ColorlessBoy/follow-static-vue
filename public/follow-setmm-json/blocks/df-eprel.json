Similar to Definition 6.22 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 30. The membership relation and the membership predicate agree, that is, ` |- ( A _E B <-> A e. B ) ` when ` B ` is a set (see ~ epelg ). Thus, ` |- 5 _E { 1 , 5 } ` ( ~ ex-eprel ). (Contributed by NM, 13-Aug-1995.)","parent":[],"children":["epelg","epelgOLD","rele","epinid0","cnvepnep","bj-elep","dfnelbr2"]}
