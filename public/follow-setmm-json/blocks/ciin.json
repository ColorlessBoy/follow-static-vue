Note: Historically (prior to 21-Oct-2005), set.mm used the notation ` |^| x e. A B ` , with the same intersection symbol as ~ cint . Although that syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm. The new syntax uses a distinguished symbol ` |^|_ ` instead of ` |^| ` and does allow LALR parsing. Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting this change.","parent":[],"children":[]}
