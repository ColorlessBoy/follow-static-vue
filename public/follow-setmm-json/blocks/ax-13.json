One of the equality and substitution axioms of predicate calculus with equality. An equivalent way to express this axiom that may be easier to understand is ` ( -. x = y -> ( -. x = z -> ( y = z -> A. x y = z ) ) ) ` (see ~ ax13b ). Recall that in the intended interpretation, our variables are metavariables ranging over the variables of predicate calculus (the object language). In order for the first antecedent ` -. x = y ` to hold, ` x ` and ` y ` must have different values and thus cannot be the same object-language variable (so they are effectively \"distinct variables\" even though no $d is present). Similarly, ` x ` and ` z ` cannot be the same object-language variable. Therefore, ` x ` will not occur in the wff ` y = z ` when the first two antecedents hold, so analogous to ~ ax-5 , the conclusion ` ( y = z -> A. x y = z ) ` follows. Note that ~ ax-5 cannot prove this because its distinct variable ($d) requirement is not satisfied directly but only indirectly (outside of Metamath) by the argument above. The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-c9 and was replaced with this shorter ~ ax-13 in December 2015. The old axiom is proved from this one as theorem ~ axc9 . The primary purpose of this axiom is to provide a way to introduce the quantifier ` A. x ` on ` y = z ` even when ` x ` and ` y ` are substituted with the same variable. In this case, the first antecedent becomes ` -. x = x ` and the axiom still holds. Although this version is shorter, the original version ~ axc9 may be more practical to work with because of the \"distinctor\" form of its antecedents. A typical application of ~ axc9 is in ~ dvelimh which converts a distinct variable pair to the distinctor antecedent ` -. A. x x = y ` . In particular, it is conjectured that it is not possible to prove ~ ax6 from ~ ax6v without this axiom. This axiom can be weakened if desired by adding distinct variable restrictions on pairs ` x , z ` and ` y , z ` . To show that, we add these restrictions to theorem ~ ax13v and use only ~ ax13v for further derivations. Thus, ~ ax13v should be the only theorem referencing this axiom. Other theorems can reference either ~ ax13v (preferred) or ~ ax13 (if the stronger form is needed). This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax13w ) but is used as an auxiliary axiom scheme to achieve scheme completeness (i.e. so that all possible cases of bundling can be proved; see text linked at ~ mmtheorems.html#ax6dgen ). It is not known whether this axiom can be derived from the others. (Contributed by NM, 21-Dec-2015.) (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax13v"]}
