A projective space of dimension 1 is a projective line, and a projective space of dimension 2 is a projective plane. Compare ~ df-ehl . This space is considered n-dimensional because the vector space ` ( k freeLMod ( 0 ... n ) ) ` is (n+1)-dimensional and the ` PrjSp ` function returns equivalence classes with respect to a linear (1-dimensional) relation.
