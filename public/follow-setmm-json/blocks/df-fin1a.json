Equivalent to definition Ia of [Levy58] p. 2. A I-infinite Ia-finite set is also known as an amorphous set. This is the second of Levy's eight definitions of finite set. Levy's I-finite is equivalent to our ~ df-fin and not repeated here. These eight definitions are equivalent with Choice but strictly decreasing in strength in models where Choice fails; conversely, they provide a series of increasingly stronger notions of infiniteness.
