This finite summation function can be extended to pairs ` <. y , z >. ` where ` y ` is a left-unital magma and ` z ` is defined on a totally ordered set (choosing left-associative composition), or dropping unitality and requiring nonempty families, or on any monoids for families of permutable elements, etc. We use the term \"summation\", even though the definition stands for any unital, commutative and associative composition law.
