A _non-unital ring_ (or rng, or pseudoring) is a set equipped with two everywhere-defined internal operations, whose first one is an additive abelian group operation and the second one is a multiplicative semigroup operation, and where the addition is left- and right-distributive for the multiplication. Definition of a pseudo-ring in section I.8.1 of [BourbakiAlg1] p. 93 or the definition of a ring in part Preliminaries of [Roman] p. 18. As almost always in mathematics, \"non-unital\" means \"not necessarily unital\". Therefore, by talking about a ring (in general) or a non-unital ring the \"unital\" case is always included. In contrast to a unital ring, the commutativity of addition must be postulated and cannot be proven from the other conditions. (Contributed by AV, 6-Jan-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["isrng"]}
