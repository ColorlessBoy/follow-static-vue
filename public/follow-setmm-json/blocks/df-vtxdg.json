To be appropriate for arbitrary hypergraphs, we have to double-count those edges that contain ` u ` \"twice\" (i.e. self-loops), this being represented as a singleton as the edge's value. Since the degree of a vertex can be (positive) infinity (if the graph containing the vertex is not of finite size), the extended addition ` +e ` is used for the summation of the number of \"ordinary\" edges\" and the number of \"loops\".
