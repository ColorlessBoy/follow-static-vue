No ` ph ` is ` ps ` , and all ` ch ` is ` ph ` , therefore no ` ch ` is ` ps ` . Instance of ~ barbara . In Aristotelian notation, EAE-1: MeP and SaM therefore SeP. For example, given the \"No reptiles have fur\" and \"All snakes are reptiles\", therefore \"No snakes have fur\". Example from ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism . (Contributed by David A.
