Our definition expresses Definition 12 of [Suppes] p. 229 in a closed form, from which we derive the recursive definition as theorems ~ aleph0 , ~ alephsuc , and ~ alephlim . The aleph function provides a one-to-one, onto mapping from the ordinal numbers to the infinite cardinal numbers. Roughly, any aleph is the smallest infinite cardinal number whose size is strictly greater than any aleph before it.
