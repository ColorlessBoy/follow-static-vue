According to Wikipedia (\"Path (graph theory)\", ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) , 3-Oct-2017): \"A trail is a walk in which all edges are distinct. According to Bollobas: \"... walk is called a trail if all its edges are distinct.\", see Definition of [Bollobas] p. 5. Therefore, a trail can be represented by an injective mapping f from { 1 , ... , n } and a mapping p from { 0 , ... , n }, where f enumerates the (indices of the) different edges, and p enumerates the vertices. So the trail is also represented by the following sequence: p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) e(f(2)) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n). (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens and Mario Carneiro, 4-Oct-2017.)
