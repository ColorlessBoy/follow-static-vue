The symbol ` -u ` is not a class by itself but part of a compound class definition. We do this rather than making it a formal function since it is so commonly used. Note: We use different symbols for unary minus ( ` -u ` ) and subtraction ~ cmin ( ` - ` ) to prevent syntax ambiguity. For example, looking at the syntax definition ~ co , if we used the same symbol then \" ` ( - A - B ) ` \" could mean either \" ` - A ` \" minus \" ` B ` \", or it could represent the (meaningless) operation of classes \" ` - ` \" and \" ` - B ` \" connected with \"operation\" \" ` A ` \". On the other hand, \" ` ( -u A - B ) ` \" is unambiguous.","parent":[],"children":[]}
