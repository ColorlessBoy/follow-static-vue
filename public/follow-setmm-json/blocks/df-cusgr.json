A simple graph is called _complete_ if every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a (unique) edge, see definition in section 1.1 of [Diestel] p. 3. In contrast, the definition in section I.1 of [Bollobas] p. 3 is based on the size of (finite) complete graphs, see ~ cusgrsize . (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 12-Oct-2017.)
