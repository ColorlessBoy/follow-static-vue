Exercise 35 of [Enderton] p. 61. This is called the equivalence class of ` A ` modulo ` R ` when ` R ` is an equivalence relation (i.e. when ` Er R ` ; see ~ dfer2 ). In this case, ` A ` is a representative (member) of the equivalence class ` [ A ] R ` , which contains all sets that are equivalent to ` A ` . Definition of [Enderton] p. 57 uses the notation ` [ A ] ` (subscript) ` R ` , although we simply follow the brackets by ` R ` since we don't have subscripted expressions. For an alternate definition, see ~ dfec2 .
