This is almost, but not quite, the same as a function into an independent set. This is a defined concept because it matters in many cases whether independence is taken at a set or family level. For instance, a number is transcedental iff its nonzero powers are linearly independent. Is 1 transcedental? It has only one nonzero power. We can almost define family independence as a family of unequal elements with independent range, as ~ islindf3 , but taking that as primitive would lead to unpleasant corner case behavior with the zero ring. This is equivalent to the common definition of having no nontrivial representations of zero ( ~ islindf4 ) and only one representation for each element of the range ( ~ islindf5 ).
