A topological space is n-locally ` A ` if every neighborhood of a point contains a sub-neighborhood that is ` A ` in the subspace topology. The terminology \"n-locally\", where 'n' stands for \"neighborhood\", is not standard, although this is sometimes called \"weakly locally ` A ` \". The reason for the distinction is that some notions only make sense for arbitrary neighborhoods (such as \"locally compact\", which is actually ` N-Locally Comp ` in our terminology - open compact sets are not very useful), while others such as \"locally connected\" are strictly weaker notions if the neighborhoods are not required to be open.
