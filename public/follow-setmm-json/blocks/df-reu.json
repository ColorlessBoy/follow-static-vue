Note: This notation is most often used to express that ` ph ` holds for exactly one element of a given class ` A ` . For this reading ` F/_ x A ` is required, though, for example, asserted when ` x ` and ` A ` are disjoint. Should instead ` A ` depend on ` x ` , you rather assert exactly one ` x ` fulfilling ` ph ` happens to be contained in the corresponding ` A ( x ) ` . This interpretation is rarely needed (see also ~ df-ral ).
