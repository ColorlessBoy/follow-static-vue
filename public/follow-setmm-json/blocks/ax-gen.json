In our axiomatization, this is the only postulated (that is, axiomatic) rule of inference of predicate calculus (together with the rule of modus ponens ~ ax-mp of propositional calculus). See, e.g., Rule 2 of [Hamilton] p. 74. This rule says that if something is unconditionally true, then it is true for all values of a variable. For example, if we have proved ` x = x ` , then we can conclude ` A. x x = x ` or even ` A. y x = x ` . Theorem ~ altru shows the special case ` A. x T. ` . The converse rule of inference ~ spi (universal instantiation, or universal specialization) shows that we can also go the other way: in other words, we can add or remove universal quantifiers from the beginning of any theorem as required. Note that the closed form ` ( ph -> A. x ph ) ` need not hold (but may hold in special cases, see ~ ax-5 ).
