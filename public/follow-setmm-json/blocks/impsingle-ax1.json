Lukasiewicz was used to construct this proof. Every formula corresponding to a detachment step was converted to its corresponding Metamath formula. mmj2 was used to unify each formula using ~ ax-mp , which in turn produced this proof. With extremely high confidence, this result shows that the Lukasiewicz proof of ~ ax-1 (step 27) is correct and that Metamath correctly verifies the proof. The same comments apply to the proofs that follow this one. (Contributed by Larry Lesyna and Jeffrey P. Machado, 2-Aug-2023.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)
