The Axiom of Choice (AC) is usually considered an extension of ZF set theory rather than a proper part of it. It is sometimes considered philosophically controversial because it asserts the existence of a set without telling us what the set is. ZF set theory that includes AC is called ZFC. The unpublished version given here says that given any set ` x ` , there exists a ` y ` that is a collection of unordered pairs, one pair for each nonempty member of ` x ` . One entry in the pair is the member of ` x ` , and the other entry is some arbitrary member of that member of ` x ` . See the rewritten version ~ ac3 for a more detailed explanation. Theorem ~ ac2 shows an equivalent written compactly with restricted quantifiers. This version was specifically crafted to be short when expanded to primitives. Kurt Maes' 5-quantifier version ~ ackm is slightly shorter when the biconditional of ~ ax-ac is expanded into implication and negation. In ~ axac3 we allow the constant ` CHOICE ` to represent the Axiom of Choice; this simplifies the representation of theorems like ~ gchac (the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis implies the Axiom of Choice). Standard textbook versions of AC are derived as ~ ac8 , ~ ac5 , and ~ ac7 . The Axiom of Regularity ~ ax-reg (among others) is used to derive our version from the standard ones; this reverse derivation is shown as theorem ~ dfac2b . Equivalents to AC are the well-ordering theorem ~ weth and Zorn's lemma ~ zorn . See ~ ac4 for comments about stronger versions of AC. In order to avoid uses of ~ ax-reg for derivation of AC equivalents, we provide ~ ax-ac2 (due to Kurt Maes), which is equivalent to the standard AC of textbooks. The derivation of ~ ax-ac2 from ~ ax-ac is shown by theorem ~ axac2 , and the reverse derivation by ~ axac . Therefore, new proofs should normally use ~ ax-ac2 instead. (New usage is discouraged.)
