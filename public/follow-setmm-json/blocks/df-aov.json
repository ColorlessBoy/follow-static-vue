In contrast to ~ df-ov , the alternative definition for a function value (see ~ df-afv ) is used. By this, the value of the operation applied to two arguments is the universal class if the operation is not defined for these two arguments. There are still no restrictions of any kind on what those class expressions may be, although only certain kinds of class expressions - a binary operation ` F ` and its arguments ` A ` and ` B ` - will be useful for proving meaningful theorems.
