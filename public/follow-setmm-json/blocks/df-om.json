Our definition is a variant of the Definition of N of [BellMachover] p. 471. See ~ dfom2 for an alternate definition. Later, when we assume the Axiom of Infinity, we show ` _om ` is a set in ~ omex , and ` _om ` can then be defined per ~ dfom3 (the smallest inductive set) and ~ dfom4 . _Note_: the natural numbers ` _om ` are a subset of the ordinal numbers ~ df-on . They are completely different from the natural numbers ` NN ` ( ~ df-nn ) that are a subset of the complex numbers defined much later in our development, although the two sets have analogous properties and operations defined on them.
