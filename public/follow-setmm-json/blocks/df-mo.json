The expression ` E* x ph ` is read \"there exists at most one ` x ` such that ` ph ` \". This is also called the \"uniqueness quantifier\" but that expression is also used for the unique existential quantifier ~ df-eu , therefore we avoid that ambiguous name.

Make this the definition (which used to be ~ moeu , while this definition was then proved as ~ dfmo ).
