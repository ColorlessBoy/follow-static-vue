Some authors, especially in analysis books, call these the natural numbers, whereas other authors choose to include 0 in their definition of natural numbers. Note that ` NN ` is a subset of complex numbers ( ~ nnsscn ), in contrast to the more elementary ordinal natural numbers ` _om ` , ~ df-om ). See ~ nnind for the principle of mathematical induction. See ~ df-n0 for the set of nonnegative integers ` NN0 ` . See ~ dfn2 for ` NN ` defined in terms of ` NN0 ` . This is a technical definition that helps us avoid the Axiom of Infinity ~ ax-inf2 in certain proofs. For a more conventional and intuitive definition (\"the smallest set of reals containing ` 1 ` as well as the successor of every member\") see ~ dfnn3 (or its slight variant ~ dfnn2 ).
