This axiom moves a quantifier from outside to inside an implication, quantifying ` ps ` . Notice that ` x ` must not be a free variable in the antecedent of the quantified implication, and we express this by binding ` ph ` to \"protect\" the axiom from a ` ph ` containing a free ` x ` . Axiom scheme C4' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It is a special case of Lemma 5 of [Monk2] p. 108 and Axiom 5 of [Mendelson] p. 69. This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used. It is proved above as theorem ~ axc4 . (Contributed by NM, 3-Jan-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax4fromc4","ax10fromc7","equid1"]}
