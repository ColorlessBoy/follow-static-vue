For sets, being an element of the class of symmetric relations is equivalent to satisfying the symmetric relation predicate, see ~ elsymrelsrel . Alternate definitions are ~ dfsymrels2 , ~ dfsymrels3 , ~ dfsymrels4 and ~ dfsymrels5 . This definition is similar to the definitions of the classes of reflexive ( ~ df-refrels ) and transitive ( ~ df-trrels ) relations.
