Definition 9.12 of [Quine] p. 64. The converse of a binary relation swaps its arguments, i.e., if ` A e. _V ` and ` B e. _V ` then ` ( A ``' R B <-> B R A ) ` , as proven in ~ brcnv (see ~ df-br and ~ df-rel for more on relations). For example, ` ``' { <. 2 , 6 >. , <. 3 , 9 >. } = { <. 6 , 2 >. , <. 9 , 3 >. } ` ( ~ ex-cnv ). We use Quine's breve accent (smile) notation. Like Quine, we use it as a prefix, which eliminates the need for parentheses. Many authors use the postfix superscript \"minus one\". The term \"converse\" is Quine's terminology; some authors call it \"inverse\", especially when the argument is a function.
