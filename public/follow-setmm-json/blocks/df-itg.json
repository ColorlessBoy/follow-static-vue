The syntax is designed to be suggestive of the standard notation for integrals. For example, our notation for the integral of ` x ^ 2 ` from ` 0 ` to ` 1 ` is ` S. ( 0 [,] 1 ) ( x ^ 2 ) _d x = ( 1 / 3 ) ` . The only real function of this definition is to break the integral up into nonnegative real parts and send it off to ~ df-itg2 for further processing. Note that this definition cannot handle integrals which evaluate to infinity, because addition and multiplication are not currently defined on extended reals. (You can use ~ df-itg2 directly for this use-case.) (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 28-Jun-2014.)","parent":[],"children":["dfitg","itgex","nfitg1"]}
