Remark: this is the same as ~ equsalhw (TODO: delete after moving the following paragraph somewhere). Remarks: ~ equsexvw has been moved to Main; the theorem ~ ax13lem2 has a dv version which is a simple consequence of ~ ax5e ; the theorems ~ nfeqf2 , ~ dveeq2 , ~ nfeqf1 , ~ dveeq1 , ~ nfeqf , ~ axc9 , ~ ax13 , have dv versions which are simple consequences of ~ ax-5 .
