For example, ` ( 5 _C 3 ) = 1 0 ` ( ~ ex-bc ). In the literature, this function is often written as a column vector of the two arguments, or with the arguments as subscripts before and after the letter \"C\".

As suggested by Gleason, we define it to be 0 when ` 0 <_ k <_ n ` does not hold. (Contributed by NM, 10-Jul-2005.)","parent":[],"children":["bcval"]}
