In contrast to the standard definition of minors, a row is replaced by 0's and one 1 instead of deleting the column and row (e.g., definition in [Lang] p. 515). By this, the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the minor determined in the standard way (as determinant of a submatrix, see ~ df-subma - note that the matrix is transposed compared with the submatrix defined in ~ df-subma , but this does not matter because the determinants are the same, see ~ mdettpos ). Such matrices are used in the definition of an adjunct of a square matrix, see ~ df-madu . (Contributed by AV, 27-Dec-2018.)","parent":[],"children":["minmar1fval"]}
