The input is a number ` m ` for the size of the edges of the hypergraph, and a tuple ` r ` from the finite color set to lower bounds for each color. The Ramsey number ` ( M Ramsey R ) ` is the smallest number such that for any set ` S ` with ` ( M Ramsey R ) <_ # S ` and any coloring ` F ` of the set of ` M ` -element subsets of ` S ` (with color set ` dom R ` ), there is a color ` c e. dom R ` and a subset ` x C_ S ` such that ` R ( c ) <_ # x ` and all the hyperedges of ` x ` (that is, subsets of ` x ` of size ` M ` ) have color ` c ` .
