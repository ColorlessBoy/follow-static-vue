C |-> ( y e. D |-> x ) ` . The value of the functor at an object ` x ` is the constant functor which maps all objects in ` D ` to ` x ` and all morphisms to ` 1 ( x ) ` . The morphism part is a natural transformation between these functors, which takes ` f : x --> y ` to the natural transformation with every component equal to ` f ` .
