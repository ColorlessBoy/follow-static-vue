Definition 10.1 of [Quine] p. 65. For example, the expression ` Fun cos ` is true once we define cosine ( ~ df-cos ). This is not the same as defining a specific function's mapping, which is typically done using the format of ~ cmpt with the maps-to notation (see ~ df-mpt and ~ df-mpo ). Contrast this predicate with the predicates to determine if some class is a function with a given domain ( ~ df-fn ), a function with a given domain and codomain ( ~ df-f ), a one-to-one function ( ~ df-f1 ), an onto function ( ~ df-fo ), or a one-to-one onto function ( ~ df-f1o ). For alternate definitions, see ~ dffun2 , ~ dffun3 , ~ dffun4 , ~ dffun5 , ~ dffun6 , ~ dffun7 , ~ dffun8 , and ~ dffun9 .
