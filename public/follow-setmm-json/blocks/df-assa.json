An associative algebra is a set equipped with a left-module structure on a (commutative) ring, coupled with a multiplicative internal operation on the vectors of the module that is associative and distributive for the additive structure of the left-module (so giving the vectors a ring structure) and that is also bilinear under the scalar product.
