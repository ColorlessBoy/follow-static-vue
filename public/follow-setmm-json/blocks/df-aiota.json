Our definition is meaningful only when there is exactly one ` x ` such that ` ph ` is true (see ~ aiotaval ); otherwise, it is not a set (see ~ aiotaexb ), or even more concrete, it is the universe ` _V ` (see ~ aiotavb ). Since this is an alternative for ~ df-iota , we call this symbol ` iota' ` _alternate iota_ in the following. The advantage of this definition is the clear distinguishability of the defined and undefined cases: the alternate iota over a wff is defined iff it is a set (see ~ aiotaexb ). With the original definition, there is no corresponding theorem ` ( E! x ph <-> ( iota x ph ) =/= (/) ) ` , because ` (/) ` can be a valid unique set satisfying a wff (see, for example, ~ iota0def ). Only the right to left implication would hold, see (negated) ~ iotanul . For defined cases, however, both definitions ~ df-iota and ~ df-aiota are equivalent, see ~ reuaiotaiota .
