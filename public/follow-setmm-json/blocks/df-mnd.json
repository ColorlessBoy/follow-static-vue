Definition 2 in [BourbakiAlg1] p. 12. In other words (according to the definition in [Lang] p. 3), a monoid is a set equipped with an everywhere defined internal operation (see ~ mndcl ), whose operation is associative (see ~ mndass ) and has a two-sided neutral element (see ~ mndid ), see also ~ ismnd .
