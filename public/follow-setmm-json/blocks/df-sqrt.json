For example, ` ( sqrt `` 2 5 ) = 5 ` ( ~ ex-sqrt ). Since ` ( y ^ 2 ) = x ` iff ` ( -u y ^ 2 ) = x ` , we ensure uniqueness by restricting the range to numbers with positive real part, or numbers with 0 real part and nonnegative imaginary part. A description can be found under \"Principal square root of a complex number\" at ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root . The square root symbol was introduced in 1525 by Christoff Rudolff. See ~ sqrtcl for its closure, ~ sqrtval for its value, ~ sqrtth and ~ sqsqrti for its relationship to squares, and ~ sqrt11i for uniqueness. (Contributed by NM, 27-Jul-1999.)
