According to Wikipedia (\"Characteristic polynomial\", 31-Jul-2019, ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial ): \"The characteristic polynomial of [an n x n matrix] A, denoted by p_A(t), is the polynomial defined by p_A ( t ) = det ( t I - A ) where I denotes the n-by-n identity matrix.\". In addition, however, the underlying ring must be commutative, see definition in [Lang], p. 561: \" Let k be a commutative ring ... Let M be any n x n matrix in k ... We define the characteristic polynomial P_M(t) to be the determinant det ( t I_n - M ) where I_n is the unit n x n matrix.\" To be more precise, the matrices A and I on the right hand side are matrices with coefficients of a polynomial ring. Therefore, the original matrix A over a given commutative ring must be transformed into corresponding matrices over the polynomial ring over the given ring.
