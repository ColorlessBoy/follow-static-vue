In our convention, a product with 0 is 0, even when the other factor is infinite. An alternate convention leaves products of 0 with an infinite number undefined since the multiplication is not continuous at these points. Note that our convention entails ` ( 0 / 0 ) = 0 ` (given ~ df-bj-invc ). Note that this definition uses ` x. ` and ` Arg ` and ` / ` . Indeed, it would be contrieved to bypass ordinary complex multiplication, and the present two-step definition looks like a good compromise.
