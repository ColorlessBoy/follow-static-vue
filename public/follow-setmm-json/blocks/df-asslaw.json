By this definition, the associative law is expressed as binary relation: a binary operation is related to a set by ` assLaw ` if the associative law holds for this binary operation regarding this set. Note that the binary operation needs neither to be closed nor to be a function. (Contributed by FL, 1-Nov-2009.) (Revised by AV, 13-Jan-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["isasslaw","asslawass"]}
