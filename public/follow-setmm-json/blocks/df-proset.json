A proset is a set equipped with a preorder, that is, a transitive and reflexive relation. Preorders are a natural generalization of partial orders which need not be antisymmetric: there may be pairs of elements such that each is \"less than or equal to\" the other, so that both elements have the same order-theoretic properties (in some sense, there is a \"tie\" among them). If a preorder is required to be antisymmetric, that is, there is no such \"tie\", then one obtains a partial order. If a preorder is required to be symmetric, that is, all comparable elements are tied, then one obtains an equivalence relation. Every preorder naturally factors into these two notions: the \"tie\" relation on a proset is an equivalence relation, and the quotient under that equivalence relation is a partial order.
