This corresponds to the axiom (D) of modal logic (the other standard formulation being ~ extru ). Note: This proof is very different from Margaris' because we only have Tarski's FOL axiom schemes available at this point. See the later ~ 19.2g for a more conventional proof of a more general result, which uses additional axioms. The reverse implication is the defining property of effective nonfreeness (see ~ df-nf ).
