See also remarks for ~ df-asin . Unlike ` arcsin ` and ` arccos ` , this function is not defined everywhere, because ` tan ( z ) =/= +- _i ` for all ` z e. CC ` . For all other ` z ` , there is a formula for ` arctan ( z ) ` in terms of ` log ` , and we take that as the definition. Branch points are at ` +- _i ` ; branch cuts are on the pure imaginary axis not between ` -u _i ` and ` _i ` , which is to say ` { z e. CC | ( _i x. z ) e. ( -oo , -u 1 ) u. ( 1 , +oo ) } ` .
