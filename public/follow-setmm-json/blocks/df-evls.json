The function ` ( ( I evalSub S ) `` R ) : V --> ( S ^m ( S ^m I ) ) ` makes sense when ` I ` is an index set, ` S ` is a ring, ` R ` is a subring of ` S ` , and where ` V ` is the set of polynomials in ` ( I mPoly R ) ` . This function maps an element of the formal polynomial algebra (with coefficients in ` R ` ) to a function from assignments ` I --> S ` of the variables to elements of ` S ` formed by evaluating the polynomial with the given assignments.
