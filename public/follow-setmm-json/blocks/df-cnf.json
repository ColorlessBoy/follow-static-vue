The content of the original Cantor Normal Form theorem is that for ` x = _om ` this function is a bijection onto ` _om ^o y ` for any ordinal ` y ` (or, since the function restricts naturally to different ordinals, the statement that the composite function is a bijection to ` On ` ). More can be said about the function, however, and in particular it is an order isomorphism for a certain easily defined well-ordering of the finitely supported functions, which gives an alternate definition ~ cantnffval2 of this function in terms of ~ df-oi .
