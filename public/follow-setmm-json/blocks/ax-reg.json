An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Also called the Axiom of Foundation. A rather non-intuitive axiom that denies more than it asserts, it states (in the form of ~ zfreg ) that every nonempty set contains a set disjoint from itself. One consequence is that it denies the existence of a set containing itself ( ~ elirrv ). A stronger version that works for proper classes is proved as ~ zfregs .
