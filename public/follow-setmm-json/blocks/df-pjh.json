Every closed subspace is associated with a unique projection function. Remark in [Kalmbach] p. 66, adopted as a definition. ` ( projh `` H ) `` A ` is the projection of vector ` A ` onto closed subspace ` H ` . Note that the range of ` projh ` is the set of all projection operators, so ` T e. ran projh ` means that ` T ` is a projection operator. (Contributed by NM, 23-Oct-1999.)
