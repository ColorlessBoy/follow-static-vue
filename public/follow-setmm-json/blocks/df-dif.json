Definition 5.12 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 20. For example, ` ( { 1 , 3 } \\ { 1 , 8 } ) = { 3 } ` ( ~ ex-dif ). Contrast this operation with union ` ( A u. B ) ` ( ~ df-un ) and intersection ` ( A i^i B ) ` ( ~ df-in ). Several notations are used in the literature; we chose the ` \\ ` convention used in Definition 5.3 of [Eisenberg] p. 67 instead of the more common minus sign to reserve the latter for later use in, e.g., arithmetic. We will use the terminology \" ` A ` excludes ` B ` \" to mean ` A \\ B ` . We will use \" ` B ` is removed from ` A ` \" to mean ` A \\ { B } ` i.e. the removal of an element or equivalently the exclusion of a singleton.
