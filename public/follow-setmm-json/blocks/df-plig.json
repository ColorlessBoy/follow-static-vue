We use Hilbert's axioms and adapt them to planar geometry. We use ` e. ` for the incidence relation. We could have used a generic binary relation, but using ` e. ` allows us to reuse previous results. Much of what follows is directly borrowed from Aitken, _Incidence-Betweenness Geometry_, 2008, ~ http://public.csusm.edu/aitken_html/m410/betweenness.08.pdf . The class ` Plig ` is the class of planar incidence geometries, where a planar incidence geometry is defined as a set of lines satisfying three axioms. In the definition below, ` x ` denotes a planar incidence geometry, so ` U. x ` denotes the union of its lines, that is, the set of points in the plane, ` l ` denotes a line, and ` a , b , c ` denote points. Therefore, the axioms are: 1) for all pairs of (distinct) points, there exists a unique line containing them; 2) all lines contain at least two points; 3) there exist three non-collinear points.
