An undirected simple hypergraph is a special (non-simple, multiple, multi-) hypergraph for which the edge function ` e ` is an injective (one-to-one) function into subsets of the set of vertices ` v ` , representing the (one or more) vertices incident to the edge. This definition corresponds to the definition of hypergraphs in section I.1 of [Bollobas] p. 7 (except that the empty set seems to be allowed to be an \"edge\") or section 1.10 of [Diestel] p. 27, where \"E is a subset of [[...] the power set of V, that is the set of all subsets of V\" resp. \"the elements of E are nonempty subsets (of any cardinality) of V\".
