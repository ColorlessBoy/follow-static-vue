This definition is very general: It defines edges of a class as the range of its edge function (which does not even need to be a function). Therefore, this definition could also be used for hypergraphs, pseudographs and multigraphs. In these cases, however, the (possibly more than one) edges connecting the same vertices could not be distinguished anymore. In some cases, this is no problem, so theorems with ` Edg ` are meaningful nevertheless (e.g., ~ edguhgr ). Usually, however, this definition is used only for undirected simple (hyper-/pseudo-)graphs (with or without loops). (Contributed by AV, 1-Jan-2020.)
