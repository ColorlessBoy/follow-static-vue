See theorem ~ ndxarg to understand its purpose. The restriction to ` NN ` ensures that ` ndx ` is a set. The restriction to some set is necessary since ` _I ` is a proper class. In principle, we could have chosen ` CC ` or (if we revise all structure component definitions such as ~ df-base ) another set such as the set of finite ordinals ` _om ` ( ~ df-om ).
