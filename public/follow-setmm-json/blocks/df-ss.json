Exercise 9 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 18. For example, ` { 1 , 2 } C_ { 1 , 2 , 3 } ` ( ~ ex-ss ). Note that ` A C_ A ` (proved in ~ ssid ). Contrast this relationship with the relationship ` A C. B ` (as will be defined in ~ df-pss ). For a more traditional definition, but requiring a dummy variable, see ~ dfss2 . Other possible definitions are given by ~ dfss3 , ~ dfss4 , ~ sspss , ~ ssequn1 , ~ ssequn2 , ~ sseqin2 , and ~ ssdif0 . We prefer the label \"ss\" (\"subset\") for ` C_ ` , despite the fact that it applies to classes. It is much more common to refer to this as the subset relation than subclass, especially since most of the time the arguments are in fact sets (and for pragmatic reasons we don't want to need to use different operations for sets). The way set.mm is set up, many things are technically classes despite morally (and provably) being sets, like ` 1 ` (cf. ~ df-1 and ~ 1ex ) or ` RR ` ( cf. ~ df-r and ~ reex ). This has to do with the fact that there are no \"set expressions\": classes are expressions but there are only set variables in set.mm (cf. ~ http://us.metamath.org/downloads/grammar-ambiguity.txt ). This is why we use ` C_ ` both for subclass relations and for subset relations and call it \"subset\".
