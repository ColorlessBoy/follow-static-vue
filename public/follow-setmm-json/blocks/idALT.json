This version is proved directly from the axioms for demonstration purposes. This proof is a popular example in the literature and is identical, step for step, to the proofs of Theorem 1 of [Margaris] p. 51, Example 2.7(a) of [Hamilton] p. 31, Lemma 10.3 of [BellMachover] p. 36, and Lemma 1.8 of [Mendelson] p. 36. It is also \"Our first proof\" in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic and Proof_ p. 17 (PDF p. 23) at ~ http://www.appstate.edu/~~hirstjl/primer/hirst.pdf . Note that the second occurrences of ` ph ` in Steps 1 to 4 and the sixth in Step 3 may be simultaneously replaced by any wff ` ps ` , which may ease the understanding of the proof. For a shorter version of the proof that takes advantage of previously proved theorems, see ~ id . (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) (Proof modification is discouraged.) Use ~ id instead.
