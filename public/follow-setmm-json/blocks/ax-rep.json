An axiom scheme of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Axiom 5 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 19. It tells us that the image of any set under a function is also a set (see the variant ~ funimaex ). Although ` ph ` may be any wff whatsoever, this axiom is useful (i.e. its antecedent is satisfied) when we are given some function and ` ph ` encodes the predicate \"the value of the function at ` w ` is ` z ` \". Thus, ` ph ` will ordinarily have free variables ` w ` and ` z ` - think of it informally as ` ph ( w , z ) ` . We prefix ` ph ` with the quantifier ` A. y ` in order to \"protect\" the axiom from any ` ph ` containing ` y ` , thus allowing us to eliminate any restrictions on ` ph ` . Another common variant is derived as ~ axrep5 , where you can find some further remarks. A slightly more compact version is shown as ~ axrep2 . A quite different variant is ~ zfrep6 , which if used in place of ~ ax-rep would also require that the Separation Scheme ~ axsep be stated as a separate axiom. There is a very strong generalization of Replacement that doesn't demand function-like behavior of ` ph ` . Two versions of this generalization are called the Collection Principle ~ cp and the Boundedness Axiom ~ bnd . Many developments of set theory distinguish the uses of Replacement from uses of the weaker axioms of Separation ~ axsep , Null Set ~ axnul , and Pairing ~ axpr , all of which we derive from Replacement. In order to make it easier to identify the uses of those redundant axioms, we restate them as axioms ~ ax-sep , ~ ax-nul , and ~ ax-pr below the theorems that prove them.
