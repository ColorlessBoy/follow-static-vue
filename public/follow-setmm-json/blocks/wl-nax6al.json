This theorem actually shows that ~ ax-5 is provable there. Also we cannot assume that ~ sp generally holds, except of course in the form of ~ sptruw . Without the support of an ~ sp like theorem it seems difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a theorem allowing to change the bounded variable in the antecedent. Additional axioms need to be postulated to further strengthen this result. A consequence of this result is that ` E. x ph ` is not true for any ` ph ` . In particular, ` E* x ph ` does not hold either, a somewhat counterintuitive result.
