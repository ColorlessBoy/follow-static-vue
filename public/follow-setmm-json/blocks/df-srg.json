A semiring is a set equipped with two everywhere-defined internal operations, whose first one is an additive commutative monoid structure and the second one is a multiplicative monoid structure, and where multiplication is (left- and right-) distributive over addition. Compared to the definition of a ring, this definition also adds that the additive identity is an absorbing element of the multiplicative law, as this cannot be deduced from distributivity alone. Definition of [Golan] p. 1. Note that our semirings are unital. Such semirings are sometimes called \"rigs\", being \"rings without negatives\".
