In this definition, a structure ` w ` is a Hausdorff completion of a uniform structure ` u ` if ` w ` is a complete uniform space, in which ` u ` is dense, and which admits the same uniform structure. Theorem 3 of [BourbakiTop1] p. II.21. states the existence and uniqueness of such a completion. (Contributed by Thierry Arnoux, 5-Mar-2018.)","parent":[],"children":[""]}
