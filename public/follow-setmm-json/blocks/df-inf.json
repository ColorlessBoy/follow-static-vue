It is meaningful when ` R ` is a relation that strictly orders ` B ` and when the infimum exists. For example, ` R ` could be 'less than', ` B ` could be the set of real numbers, and ` A ` could be the set of all positive reals; in this case the infimum is 0. The infimum is defined as the supremum using the converse ordering relation. In the given example, 0 is the supremum of all reals (greatest real number) for which all positive reals are greater.
