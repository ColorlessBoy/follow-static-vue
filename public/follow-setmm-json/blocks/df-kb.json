In Dirac notation, ` | A >. ` ` <. B | ` is an operator known as the outer product of ` A ` and ` B ` , which we represent by ` ( A ketbra B ) ` . Based on Equation 8.1 of [Prugovecki] p. 376. This definition, combined with definition ~ df-bra , allows any legal juxtaposition of bras and kets to make sense formally and also to obey the associative law when mapped back to Dirac notation.
