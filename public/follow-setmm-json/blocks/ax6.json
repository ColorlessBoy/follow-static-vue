(Even though this theorem depends on ~ ax-6 , all references of ~ ax-6 are made via ~ ax6v . An earlier version stated ~ ax6v as a separate axiom, but having two axioms caused some confusion.) This theorem should be referenced in place of ~ ax-6 so that all proofs can be traced back to ~ ax6v . When possible, use the weaker ~ ax6v rather than ~ ax6 since the ~ ax6v derivation is much shorter and requires fewer axioms. (Contributed by NM, 12-Nov-2013.) (Revised by NM, 25-Jul-2015.)
