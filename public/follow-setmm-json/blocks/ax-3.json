Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49. One of the 3 axioms of propositional calculus. It swaps or \"transposes\" the order of the consequents when negation is removed. An informal example is that the statement \"if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining\" implies the statement \"if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky\". This axiom is called _Transp_ or \"the principle of transposition\" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103). We will also use the term \"contraposition\" for this principle, although the reader is advised that in the field of philosophical logic, \"contraposition\" has a different technical meaning.
