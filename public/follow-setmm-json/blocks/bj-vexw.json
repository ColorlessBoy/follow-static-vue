Therefore, ` { x | ph } ` is \"a\" universal class. This is the closest one can get to defining a universal class, or proving ~ vex , without using ~ ax-ext . Note that this theorem has no disjoint variable condition and does not use ~ df-clel nor ~ df-cleq either: only first-order logic and ~ df-clab . Without ~ ax-ext , one cannot define \"the\" universal class, since one could not prove for instance the justification theorem ` { x | T. } = { y | T. } ` (see ~ vjust ). Indeed, in order to prove any equality of classes, one needs ~ df-cleq , which has ~ ax-ext as a hypothesis. Therefore, the classes ` { x | T. } ` , ` { y | ( ph -> ph ) } ` , ` { z | ( A. t t = t -> A. t t = t ) } ` and countless others are all universal classes whose equality one cannot prove without ~ ax-ext . See also ~ bj-issetw . Its degenerate instance is a simple consequence of ~ abid . (Contributed by BJ, 13-Jun-2019.)
