For equivalent definitions see ~ dff1o2 , ~ dff1o3 , ~ dff1o4 , and ~ dff1o5 . Compare Definition 6.15(6) of [TakeutiZaring] p. 27. We use their notation (\"1-1\" above the arrow and \"onto\" below the arrow). A one-to-one onto function is also called a \"bijection\" or a \"bijective function\", ` F : A -1-1-onto-> B ` can be read as \" ` F ` is a bijection between ` A ` and ` B ` \". Bijections are precisely the isomorphisms in the category ` SetCat ` of sets and set functions, see ~ setciso . Therefore, two sets are called \"isomorphic\" if there is a bijection between them. According to ~ isof1oidb , two sets are isomorphic iff there is an isomorphism ` Isom ` regarding the identity relation. In this case, the two sets are also \"equinumerous\", see ~ bren .
