For equivalent definitions see ~ dff12 and ~ dff13 . Compare Definition 6.15(5) of [TakeutiZaring] p. 27. We use their notation (\"1-1\" above the arrow). A one-to-one function is also called an \"injection\" or an \"injective function\", ` F : A -1-1-> B ` can be read as \" ` F ` is an injection from ` A ` into ` B ` \". Injections are precisely the monomorphisms in the category ` SetCat ` of sets and set functions, see ~ setcmon .
