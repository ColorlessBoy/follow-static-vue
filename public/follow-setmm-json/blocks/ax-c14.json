One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality. Axiom scheme C14' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). It is redundant if we include ~ ax-5 ; see theorem ~ axc14 . Alternately, ~ ax-5 becomes unnecessary in principle with this axiom, but we lose the more powerful metalogic afforded by ~ ax-5 . We retain ~ ax-c14 here to provide completeness for systems with the simpler metalogic that results from omitting ~ ax-5 , which might be easier to study for some theoretical purposes. This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used. It is proved above as theorem ~ axc14 . (Contributed by NM, 24-Jun-1993.) (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax5el","ax12el"]}
