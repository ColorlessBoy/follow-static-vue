According to Wikipedia (\"Cycle (graph theory)\", ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) , 3-Oct-2017): \"A simple cycle may be defined either as a closed walk with no repetitions of vertices and edges allowed, other than the repetition of the starting and ending vertex.\" According to Bollobas: \"If a walk W = x0 x1 ... x(l) is such that l >= 3, x0=x(l), and the vertices x(i), 0 < i < l, are distinct from each other and x0, then W is said to be a cycle.\" See Definition of [Bollobas] p. 5. However, since a walk consisting of distinct vertices (except the first and the last vertex) is a path, a cycle can be defined as path whose first and last vertices coincide. So a cycle is represented by the following sequence: p(0) e(f(1)) p(1) ... p(n-1) e(f(n)) p(n)=p(0). (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 3-Oct-2017.)
