An (undirected) pseudograph consists of a set ` v ` (of \"vertices\") and a function ` e ` (representing indexed \"edges\") into subsets of ` v ` of cardinality one or two, representing the two vertices incident to the edge, or the one vertex if the edge is a loop. This is according to Chartrand, Gary and Zhang, Ping (2012): \"A First Course in Graph Theory.\", Dover, ISBN 978-0-486-48368-9, section 1.4, p. 26: \"In a pseudograph, not only are parallel edges permitted but an edge is also permitted to join a vertex to itself. Such an edge is called a loop.\" (in contrast to a multigraph, see ~ df-umgr ). (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 11-Mar-2015.) (Revised by AV, 24-Nov-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["isupgr"]}
