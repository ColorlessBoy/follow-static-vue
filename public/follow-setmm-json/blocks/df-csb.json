The underlined brackets distinguish it from the substitution into a wff, ~ wsbc , to prevent ambiguity. Theorem ~ sbcel1g shows an example of how ambiguity could arise if we did not use distinguished brackets. When ` A ` is a proper class, this evaluates to the empty set (see ~ csbprc ). Theorem ~ sbccsb recovers substitution into a wff from this definition.
