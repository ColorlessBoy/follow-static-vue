See ~ exlimi for a more general version requiring more axioms. This inference, along with its many variants such as ~ rexlimdv , is used to implement a metatheorem called \"Rule C\" that is given in many logic textbooks. See, for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C in [Margaris] p. 40, or Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF p. 65) at ~ http://www.appstate.edu/~~hirstjl/primer/hirst.pdf . In informal proofs, the statement \"Let ` C ` be an element such that...\" almost always means an implicit application of Rule C. In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x ` exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( C ) ` as a hypothesis for the proof where ` C ` is a new (fictitious) constant not appearing previously in the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved. The purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier. We cannot do this in Metamath directly. Instead, we use the original ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the proof. We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` . Then we apply ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` . Finally, we separately prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at the final theorem ` ps ` , see ~ exlimiiv . (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.)
