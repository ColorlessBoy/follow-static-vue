In the literature, the argument of the aleph function is often written as a subscript, and the first aleph is written ` aleph ` _0. Exercise 3 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 91. Also Definition 12(i) of [Suppes] p. 228. From Mosh&eacute Machover, _Set Theory, Logic, and Their Limitations_, p. 95: \"Aleph...the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet...is also the first letter of the Hebrew word...(_einsoph_, meaning infinity), which is a cabbalistic appellation of the deity. The notation is due to Cantor, who was deeply interested in mysticism.\" (Contributed by NM, 21-Oct-2003.)
