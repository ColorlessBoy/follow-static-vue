This definition somewhat awkwardly mixes ` ZZ ` (via ` mzPoly ` ) and ` NN0 ` (to define the zero sets); the former could be avoided by considering coincidence sets of ` NN0 ` polynomials at the cost of requiring two, and the second is driven by consistency with our mu-recursive functions and the requirements of the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich proof. Both are avoidable at a complexity cost. In particular, it is a consequence of ~ 4sq that implicitly restricting variables to ` NN0 ` adds no expressive power over allowing them to range over ` ZZ ` . While this definition stipulates a specific index set for the polynomials, there is actually flexibility here, see ~ eldioph2b .
