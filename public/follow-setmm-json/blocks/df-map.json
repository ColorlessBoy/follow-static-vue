The set of all functions that map from ` B ` to ` A ` is written ` ( A ^m B ) ` (see ~ mapval ). Many authors write ` A ` followed by ` B ` as a superscript for this operation and rely on context to avoid confusion other exponentiation operations (e.g., Definition 10.42 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 95). Other authors show ` B ` as a prefixed superscript, which is read \" ` A ` pre ` B ` \" (e.g., definition of [Enderton] p. 52). Definition 8.21 of [Eisenberg] p. 125 uses the notation Map( ` B ` , ` A ` ) for our ` ( A ^m B ) ` . The up-arrow is used by Donald Knuth for iterated exponentiation (_Science_ 194, 1235-1242, 1976). We adopt the first case of his notation (simple exponentiation) and subscript it with _m_ to distinguish it from other kinds of exponentiation.
