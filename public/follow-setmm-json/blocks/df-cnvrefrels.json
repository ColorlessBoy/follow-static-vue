This is practically ~ dfcnvrefrels2 (which uses the traditional subclass relation ` C_ ` ) : we use converse subset relation ( ~ brcnvssr ) here to ensure the comparability to the definitions of the classes of all reflexive ( ~ df-ref ), symmetric ( ~ df-syms ) and transitive ( ~ df-trs ) sets. We use this concept to define functions ( ~ df-funsALTV , ~ df-funALTV ) and disjoints ( ~ df-disjs , ~ df-disjALTV ). For sets, being an element of the class of converse reflexive relations is equivalent to satisfying the converse reflexive relation predicate, see ~ elcnvrefrelsrel . Alternate definitions are ~ dfcnvrefrels2 and ~ dfcnvrefrels3 . (Contributed by Peter Mazsa, 7-Jul-2019.)","parent":[],"children":["dfcnvrefrels2","dfcnvrefrels3"]}
