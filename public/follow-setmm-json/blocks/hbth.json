This and later \"hypothesis-building\" lemmas, with labels starting \"hb...\", allow us to construct proofs of formulas of the form ` |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) ` from smaller formulas of this form. These are useful for constructing hypotheses that state \" ` x ` is (effectively) not free in ` ph ` \". (Contributed by NM, 11-May-1993.) This hb* idiom is generally being replaced by the nf* idiom (see ~ nfth ), but keeps its interest in some cases. (Revised by BJ, 23-Sep-2022.)","parent":["a1i","ax-gen"],"children":["spfalw"]}
