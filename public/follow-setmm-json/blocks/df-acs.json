These are termed _algebraic closure systems_; similar to definition (A) of an algebraic closure system in [Schechter] p. 84, but to avoid the complexity of an arbitrary mixed collection of functions of various arities (especially if the axiom of infinity ~ omex is to be avoided), we consider a single function defined on finite sets instead.
