It may be viewed as a product (if ` G ` is a multiplication), a sum (if ` G ` is an addition) or any other operation. The variable ` k ` is normally a free variable in ` B ` (i.e., ` B ` can be thought of as ` B ( k ) ` ). The definition is meaningful in different contexts, depending on the size of the index set ` A ` and each demanding different properties of ` G ` . 1. If ` A = (/) ` and ` G ` has an identity element, then the sum equals this identity. 2. If ` A = ( M ... N ) ` and ` G ` is any magma, then the sum is the sum of the elements, evaluated left-to-right, i.e. ` ( B ( 1 ) + B ( 2 ) ) + B ( 3 ) ` etc. 3. If ` A ` is a finite set (or is nonzero for finitely many indices) and ` G ` is a commutative monoid, then the sum adds up these elements in some order, which is then uniquely defined. 4. If ` A ` is an infinite set and ` G ` is a Hausdorff topological group, then there is a meaningful sum, but ` gsum ` cannot handle this case. See ~ df-tsms . Remark: this definition is required here because the symbol ` gsum ` is already used in ~ df-prds and ~ df-imas . The related theorems are provided later, see ~ gsumvalx .
