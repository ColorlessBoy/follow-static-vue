This version does not interpret elementhood verbatim like ` E* x e. A ph ` does. Assuming a real elementhood can lead to awkward consequences should the class ` A ` depend on ` x ` . Instead we base the definiton on ~ df-wl-ral , where this is already ruled out. This definition lets ` x ` appear as a formal parameter with no connection to ` A ` , but occurences in ` ph ` are fully honored. Alternate definitions are given in ~ wl-dfrmosb and, if ` x ` is not free in ` A ` , ~ wl-dfrmov and ~ wl-dfrmof . (Contributed by NM, 30-Aug-1993.) Isolate x from A.
