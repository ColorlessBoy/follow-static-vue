The same proof may also be interpreted as a Virtual Deduction Hilbert-style axiomatic proof. It was completed automatically by the tools program completeusersproof.cmd, which invokes Mel L. O'Cat's mmj2 and Norm Megill's Metamath Proof Assistant. ~ notnotrALT is ~ notnotrALTVD without virtual deductions and was automatically derived from ~ notnotrALTVD . Step i of the User's Proof corresponds to step i of the Fitch-style proof. <HTML> <TABLE> <TR> <TD> 1:: <TD> ` |- (. -. -. ph ->. -. -. ph ). ` <TR> <TD> 2:: <TD> ` |- ( -. -. ph -> ( -. ph -> -. -. -. ph ) ) ` <TR> <TD> 3:1: <TD> ` |- (. -. -. ph ->.
