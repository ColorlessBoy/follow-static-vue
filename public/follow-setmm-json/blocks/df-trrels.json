For sets, being an element of the class of transitive relations is equivalent to satisfying the transitive relation predicate, see ~ eltrrelsrel . Alternate definitions are ~ dftrrels2 and ~ dftrrels3 . This definition is similar to the definitions of the classes of reflexive ( ~ df-refrels ) and symmetric ( ~ df-symrels ) relations.
