An alternate definition of proper substitution ~ df-sb . By introducing a dummy variable ` z ` in the definiens, we are able to eliminate any distinct variable restrictions among the variables ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` ph ` of the definiendum. No distinct variable conflicts arise because ` z ` effectively insulates ` x ` from ` y ` . To achieve this, we use a chain of two substitutions in the form of ~ sb5 , first ` z ` for ` x ` then ` y ` for ` z ` . Compare Definition 2.1'' of [Quine] p. 17, which is obtained from this theorem by applying ~ df-clab . Theorem ~ sb7h provides a version where ` ph ` and ` z ` don't have to be distinct.
