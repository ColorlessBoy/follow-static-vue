This is read \" ` x ` is not free in ` A ` \". Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the value of ` A ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` A ` is effectively bound by a \"for all\" or something that expands to one (such as \"there exists\"). It is defined in terms of the not-free predicate ~ df-nf for wffs; see that definition for more information.
