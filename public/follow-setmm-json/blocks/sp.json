A universally quantified wff implies the wff without a quantifier. Axiom scheme B5 of [Tarski] p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77). Also appears as Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). This corresponds to the axiom (T) of modal logic. For the axiom of specialization presented in many logic textbooks, see theorem ~ stdpc4 . This theorem shows that our obsolete axiom ~ ax-c5 can be derived from the others. The proof uses ideas from the proof of Lemma 21 of [Monk2] p. 114. It appears that this scheme cannot be derived directly from Tarski's axioms without auxiliary axiom scheme ~ ax-12 . It is thought the best we can do using only Tarski's axioms is ~ spw . Also see ~ spvw where ` x ` and ` ph ` are disjoint, using fewer axioms. (Contributed by NM, 21-May-2008.)
