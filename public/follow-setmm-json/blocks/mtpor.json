This is similar to ~ mtpxor , one of the five original \"indemonstrables\" in Stoic logic. However, in Stoic logic this rule used exclusive-or, while the name modus tollendo ponens often refers to a variant of the rule that uses inclusive-or instead. The rule says, \"if ` ph ` is not true, and ` ph ` or ` ps ` (or both) are true, then ` ps ` must be true\". An alternate phrasing is: \"once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth\". -- Sherlock Holmes (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1890: The Sign of the Four, ch. 6).
