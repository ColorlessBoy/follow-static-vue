One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate calculus. The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of expressing \" ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` \" (cf. ~ sb6 ). It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases. The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-c15 and was replaced with this shorter ~ ax-12 in Jan. 2007. The old axiom is proved from this one as theorem ~ axc15 . Conversely, this axiom is proved from ~ ax-c15 as theorem ~ ax12 . Juha Arpiainen proved the metalogical independence of this axiom (in the form of the older axiom ~ ax-c15 ) from the others on 19-Jan-2006. See item 9a at ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html . See ~ ax12v and ~ ax12v2 for other equivalents of this axiom that (unlike this axiom) have distinct variable restrictions. This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax12w ) but is used as an auxiliary axiom scheme to achieve scheme completeness. (Contributed by NM, 22-Jan-2007.)
