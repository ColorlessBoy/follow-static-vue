Using proof-shortening techniques pioneered by Mr. Mel L. O'Cat, along with the latest supercomputer technology, Prof. Loof Lirpa and colleagues were able to shorten Whitehead and Russell's 360-page proof that 1+1=2 in _Principia Mathematica_ to this remarkable proof only two steps long, thus establishing a new world's record for this famous theorem.
