The rule says, \"if ` ps ` is not true, and ` ph ` implies ` ps ` , then ` ph ` must also be not true\". Modus tollens is short for \"modus tollendo tollens\", a Latin phrase that means \"the mode that by denying denies\" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39. It is also called denying the consequent. Modus tollens is closely related to modus ponens ~ ax-mp . Note that this rule is also valid in intuitionistic logic. Inference associated with ~ con3i . (Contributed by NM, 19-Aug-1993.)
