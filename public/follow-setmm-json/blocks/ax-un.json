An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. It states that a set ` y ` exists that includes the union of a given set ` x ` i.e. the collection of all members of the members of ` x ` . The variant ~ axun2 states that the union itself exists. A version with the standard abbreviation for union is ~ uniex2 . A version using class notation is ~ uniex . The union of a class ~ df-uni should not be confused with the union of two classes ~ df-un . Their relationship is shown in ~ unipr .
