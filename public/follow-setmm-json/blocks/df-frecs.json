Similar to ~ df-wrecs and ~ df-recs , it is a direct definition form of normally recursive relationships. Unlike the former two definitions, it only requires a founded set-like relationship for its properties, not a well-founded relationship. However, the proof of this requires the Axiom of Infinity, so we retain the other definitions since their properties do not require it.
