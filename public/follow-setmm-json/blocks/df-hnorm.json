See ~ normval for its value and ~ normcl for its closure. Theorems ~ norm-i-i , ~ norm-ii-i , and ~ norm-iii-i show it has the expected properties of a norm. In the literature, the norm of ` A ` is usually written \"|| ` A ` ||\", but we use function notation to take advantage of our existing theorems about functions. Definition of norm in [Beran] p. 96.
