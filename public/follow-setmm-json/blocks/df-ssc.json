Despite the name, this is not really a \"category-aware\" definition, which is to say it makes no explicit references to homsets or composition; instead this is a subset-like relation on the functions that are used as subcategory specifications in ~ df-subc , which makes it play an analogous role to the subset relation applied to the subgroups of a group.
