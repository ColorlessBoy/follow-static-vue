Kleene's \"empty conjunction\" is logically equivalent to ` T. ` . In a virtual deduction we shall interpret ` T. ` to be the empty wff or the empty collection of virtual hypotheses. ` T. ` in a virtual deduction translated into conventional notation we shall interpret to be Kleene's empty conjunction. If ` th ` is true given the empty collection of virtual hypotheses and another collection of virtual hypotheses, then it is true given only the other collection of virtual hypotheses.
