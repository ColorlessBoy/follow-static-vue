Converse of ~ notnot and one implication of ~ notnotb . Theorem *2.14 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 102. This was the fifth axiom of Frege, specifically Proposition 31 of [Frege1879] p. 44. In classical logic (our logic) this is always true. In intuitionistic logic this is not always true, and formulas for which it is true are called \"stable\". (Contributed by NM, 29-Dec-1992.)
