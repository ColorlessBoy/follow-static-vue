This version does not interpret elementhood verbatim as ` E. x e. A ph ` does. Assuming a real elementhood can lead to awkward consequences should the class ` A ` depend on ` x ` . Instead we base the definiton on ~ df-wl-ral , where this is ruled out. Other definitions are ~ wl-dfrexsb and ~ wl-dfrexex . If ` x ` is not free in ` A ` , the defining expression can be simplified (see ~ wl-dfrexf , ~ wl-dfrexv ). This definition lets ` x ` appear as a formal parameter with no connection to ` A ` , but occurences in ` ph ` are fully honored. (Contributed by NM, 30-Aug-1993.) Isolate x from A.
