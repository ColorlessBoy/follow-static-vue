See ~ chsupval2 for its value. We actually define the supremum for an arbitrary collection of Hilbert space subsets, not just elements of the Hilbert lattice ` CH ` , to allow more general theorems. Even for general subsets the supremum still a Hilbert lattice element; see ~ hsupcl . (Contributed by NM, 9-Dec-2003.) (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["hsupval"]}
