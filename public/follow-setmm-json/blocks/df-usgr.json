An undirected simple graph is a special undirected simple pseudograph (see ~ usgruspgr ), consisting of a set ` v ` (of \"vertices\") and an injective (one-to-one) function ` e ` (representing (indexed) \"edges\") into subsets of ` v ` of cardinality two, representing the two vertices incident to the edge. In contrast to an undirected simple pseudograph, an undirected simple graph has no loops (edges connecting a vertex with itself). (Contributed by Alexander van der Vekens, 10-Aug-2017.)
