'The' Borel sigma-algebra here refers to the sigma-algebra generated by the topology of open intervals on real numbers. The Borel algebra of a given topology ` J ` is the sigma-algebra generated by ` J ` , ` ( sigaGen `` J ) ` , so there is no need to introduce a special constant function for Borel sigma-algebra.
