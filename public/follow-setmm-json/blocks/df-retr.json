We say that ` R ` is a retraction from ` J ` to ` K ` . or ` R e. ( J Retr K ) ` iff there is an ` S ` such that ` R : J --> K , S : K --> J ` are continuous functions called the retraction and section respectively, and their composite ` R o. S ` is homotopic to the identity map. If a retraction exists, we say ` J ` is a retract of ` K ` . (This terminology is borrowed from HoTT and appears to be nonstandard, although it has similaries to the concept of retract in the category of topological spaces and to a deformation retract in general topology.) Two topological spaces that are retracts of each other are called homotopy equivalent. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 11-Feb-2015.)","parent":[],"children":[""]}
