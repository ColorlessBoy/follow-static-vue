Conversely, we sometimes suffix with \"f\" the label of a theorem introducing such a non-freeness hypothesis (\"f\" stands for \"not free in\", see ~ df-nf ) instead of a disjoint variable condition. For instance, ~ 19.21v versus ~ 19.21 and ~ vtoclf versus ~ vtocl . Note that \"not free in\" is less restrictive than \"does not occur in\". Note that the version with a disjoint variable condition is easily proved from the version with the corresponding non-freeness hypothesis, by using ~ nfv . However, the dv version can often be proved from fewer axioms. (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.) Reduce dependencies on axioms. (Revised by Wolf Lammen, 2-Jan-2020.)
