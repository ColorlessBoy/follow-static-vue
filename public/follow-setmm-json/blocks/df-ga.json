A group ` G ` acts on a set ` S ` if a permutation on ` S ` is associated with every element of ` G ` in such a way that the identity permutation on ` S ` is associated with the neutral element of ` G ` , and the composition of the permutations associated with two elements of ` G ` is identical with the permutation associated with the composition of these two elements (in the same order) in the group ` G ` .
