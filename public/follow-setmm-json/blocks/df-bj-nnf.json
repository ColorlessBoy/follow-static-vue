Compared with ~ df-nf , the present definition is stricter on minimal propositional calculus ( ~ bj-nnfnfTEMP ) and equivalent on FOL ( ~ bj-nfnnfTEMP ). While being stricter, it still holds for non-occurring variables ( ~ bj-nnfv ), which is the basic requirement for this quantifier. In particular, it translates more closely the associated disjointness condition. Since the nonfreeness quantifier is a means to translate a disjointness condition from the metalogic to the logic, it seems preferable. Also, since nonfreeness is mainly used as a hypothesis, this definition would allow more theorems, notably the 19.xx theorems, to be proved from the core axioms, without needing a 19.xxv variant. One can devise infinitely many definitions increasingly close to the non-occurring condition, like ` ( ( E. x ph -> ph ) /\\ ( ph -> A. x ph ) ) /\\ ` ` A. x ( ( E. x ph -> ph ) /\\ ( ph -> A. x ph ) ) /\\ A. x A. x ` ... and each stronger definition would permit more theorems to be proved from the core axioms. A reasonable rule seems to be to stop before nested quantifiers appear (since they typically require ~ ax-10 to work with). (On the other hand, going one more step would allow to prove virtually all the theorems we currently have...).
