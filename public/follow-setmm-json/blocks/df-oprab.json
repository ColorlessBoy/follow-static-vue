This is a special case of Definition 4.16 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14. Normally ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` z ` are distinct, although the definition doesn't strictly require it. See ~ df-ov for the value of an operation. The brace notation is called \"class abstraction\" by Quine; it is also called a \"class builder\" in the literature. The value of the most common operation class builder is given by ~ ovmpt2 .
