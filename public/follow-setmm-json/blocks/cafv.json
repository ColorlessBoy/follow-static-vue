Read: \"the value of ` F ` at ` A ` \" or \" ` F ` of ` A ` \". In a previous version, the symbol \" ' \" was used. However, since the similarity with the symbol ` `` ` used for the current definition of a function's value (see ~ df-fv ), which, by the way, was intended to visualize that in many cases ` `` ` and \" ' \" are exchangeable, makes reading the theorems, especially those which uses both definitions as ~ dfafv2 , very difficult, 3 apostrophes ` ''' ` are used now so that it's easier to distinguish from ~ df-fv and ~ df-ima . And not three backticks ( three times ` `` ` ) since that would be annoying to escape in a comment. (See remark of Norman Megill and Gerard Lang at ~ https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/cteNUppB6A4 ).","parent":[],"children":[]}
