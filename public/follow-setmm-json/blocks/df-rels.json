Proper class relations (like ` _I ` , see ~ reli ) are not elements of it. The element of this class and the relation predicate are the same when ` R ` is a set (see ~ elrelsrel ). The class of relations is a great tool we can use when we define classes of different relations as nullary class constants as required by the 2. point in our Guidelines ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mathbox.html . When we want to define a specific class of relations as a nullary class constant, the appropriate method is the following: 1. We define the specific nullary class constant for general sets (see e.g. ~ df-refs ), then 2. we get the required class of relations by the intersection of the class of general sets above with the class of relations ~ df-rels (see ~ df-refrels and the resulting ~ dfrefrels2 and ~ dfrefrels3 ). 3. Finally, in order to be able to work with proper classes (like ~ iprc ) as well, we define the predicate of the relation (see ~ df-refrel ) so that it is true for the relevant proper classes (see ~ refrelid ), and that the element of the class of the required relations (e.g. ~ elrefrels3 ) and this predicate are the same in case of sets (see ~ elrefrelsrel ).
