One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality. It substitutes equal variables into the right-hand side of an arbitrary binary predicate ` e. ` , which we will use for the set membership relation when set theory is introduced. This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation. Also appears as Axiom scheme C13' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). We prove in ~ ax9 that this axiom can be recovered from its weakened version ~ ax9v where ` x ` and ` y ` are assumed to be disjoint variables. In particular, the only theorem referencing ~ ax-9 should be ~ ax9v . See the comment of ~ ax9v for more details on these matters. (Contributed by NM, 21-Jun-1993.) (Revised by BJ, 7-Dec-2020.) Use ~ ax9 instead. (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax9v"]}
