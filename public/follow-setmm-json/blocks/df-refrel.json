(Read: ` R ` is a reflexive relation.) This is a surprising definition, see the comment of ~ dfrefrel3 . Alternate definitions are ~ dfrefrel2 and ~ dfrefrel3 . For sets, being an element of the class of reflexive relations ( ~ df-refrels ) is equivalent to satisfying the reflexive relation predicate, that is ` ( R e.
