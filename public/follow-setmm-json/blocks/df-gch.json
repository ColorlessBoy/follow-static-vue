In this language the generalized continuum hypothesis can be expressed as ` GCH = _V ` . A set ` x ` satisfies the generalized continuum hypothesis if it is finite or there is no set ` y ` strictly between ` x ` and its powerset in cardinality. The continuum hypothesis is equivalent to ` _om e. GCH ` . (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 15-May-2015.)","parent":[],"children":["elgch","fingch"]}
