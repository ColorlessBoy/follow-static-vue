Typically, in its final application ` ph ` would be replaced with a wff containing a (free) occurrence of the variable ` x ` , for example ` x = y ` . In a universe with a finite number of objects, \"for all\" is equivalent to a big conjunction (AND) with one wff for each possible case of ` x ` . When the universe is infinite (as with set theory), such a propositional-calculus equivalent is not possible because an infinitely long formula has no meaning, but conceptually the idea is the same.","parent":[],"children":[]}
