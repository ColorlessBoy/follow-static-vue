This is the category whose objects are all sets in a universe ` u ` regarded as extensible structures and whose morphisms are the functions between their base sets. If a set is not a real extensible structure, it is regarded as extensible structure with an empty base set. Because of ~ bascnvimaeqv we do not need to restrict the universe to sets which \"have a base\". Generally, we will take ` u ` to be a weak universe or Grothendieck universe, because these sets have closure properties as good as the real thing. (Proposed by Mario Carneiro, 5-Mar-2020.)
