Theorem 6.3 of [Quine] p. 41, or Proposition 4.6 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13, which we adopt as a definition. See these references for its metalogical justification. Note that like ~ df-cleq it extends or \"overloads\" the use of the existing membership symbol, but unlike ~ df-cleq it does not strengthen the set of valid wffs of logic when the class variables are replaced with setvar variables (see ~ cleljust ), so we don't include any set theory axiom as a hypothesis. See also comments about the syntax under ~ df-clab . Alternate definitions of ` A e. B ` (but that require either ` A ` or ` B ` to be a set) are shown by ~ clel2 , ~ clel3 , and ~ clel4 . This is called the \"axiom of membership\" by [Levy] p. 338, who treats the theory of classes as an extralogical extension to our logic and set theory axioms. While the three class definitions ~ df-clab , ~ df-cleq , and ~ df-clel are eliminable and conservative and thus meet the requirements for sound definitions, they are technically axioms in that they do not satisfy the requirements for the current definition checker. The proofs of conservativity require external justification that is beyond the scope of the definition checker. For a general discussion of the theory of classes, see ~ mmset.html#class .
