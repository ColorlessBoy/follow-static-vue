The function ` ( S evalSub1 R ) : V --> ( S ^m S ) ` makes sense when ` S ` is a ring and ` R ` is a subring of ` S ` , and where ` V ` is the set of polynomials in ` ( Poly1 `` R ) ` . This function maps an element of the formal polynomial algebra (with coefficients in ` R ` ) to a function from assignments to the variable from ` S ` into an element of ` S ` formed by evaluating the polynomial with the given assignment.
