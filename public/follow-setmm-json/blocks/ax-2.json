Axiom A2 of [Margaris] p. 49. One of the 3 axioms of propositional calculus. It \"distributes\" an antecedent over two consequents. This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known as _Frege_ in the literature; see Proposition 2 of [Frege1879] p. 26. It is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108. The other direction of this axiom also turns out to be true, as demonstrated by ~ pm5.41 .
