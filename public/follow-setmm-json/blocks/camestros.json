All ` ph ` is ` ps ` , no ` ch ` is ` ps ` , and ` ch ` exist, therefore some ` ch ` is not ` ph ` . In Aristotelian notation, AEO-2: PaM and SeM therefore SoP. For example, \"All horses have hooves\", \"No humans have hooves\", and humans exist, therefore \"Some humans are not horses\". (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 28-Aug-2016.)
