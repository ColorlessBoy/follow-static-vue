A Tarski geometry is a set of points, equipped with a betweenness relation (denoting that a point lies on a line segment between two other points) and a congruence relation (denoting equality of line segment lengths). <HTML>Here, we are using the following:<UL> <LI> for congruence, ` ( x .- y ) = ( z .- w ) ` where ` .- = ( dist `` W ) ` <LI> for betweenness, ` y e. ( x I z ) ` , where ` I = ( Itv `` W ) ` </UL> With this definition, the axiom A2 is actually equivalent to the transitivity of addition, ~ eqtrd .<P> Tarski originally had more axioms, but later reduced his list to 11:<UL> <LI> A1 A kind of reflexivity for the congruence relation (TarskiGC) <LI> A2 Transitivity for the congruence relation ( ` TarskiGC ` ) <LI> A3 Identity for the congruence relation ( ` TarskiGC ` ) <LI> A4 Axiom of segment construction ( ` TarskiGCB ` ) <LI> A5 5-segment axiom ( ` TarskiGCB ` ) <LI> A6 Identity for the betweenness relation ( ` TarskiGB ` ) <LI> A7 Axiom of Pasch ( ` TarskiGB ` ) <LI> A8 Lower dimension axiom ` ( TarskiGDim>= `` 2 ) ` <LI> A9 Upper dimension axiom ` ( _V \\ ( TarskiGDim>= `` 3 ) ) ` <LI> A10 Euclid's axiom ( ` TarskiGE ` ) <LI> A11 Axiom of continuity ( ` TarskiGB ` ) </UL> Our definition is split into 5 parts:<UL> <LI> congruence axioms ` TarskiGC ` (which metric spaces fulfill) <LI> betweenness axioms ` TarskiGB ` <LI> congruence and betweenness axioms ` TarskiGCB ` <LI> upper and lower dimension axioms ` TarskiGDim>= ` <LI> axiom of Euclid / parallel postulate ` TarskiGE ` </UL></HTML> So our definition of a Tarskian Geometry includes the 3 axioms for the quaternary congruence relation (A1, A2, A3), the 3 axioms for the ternary betweenness relation (A6, A7, A11), and the 2 axioms of compatibility of the congruence and the betweenness relations (A4,A5). It does not include Euclid's axiom A10, nor the 2-dimensional axioms A8 (Lower dimension axiom) and A9 (Upper dimension axiom) so the number of dimensions of the geometry it formalizes is not constrained. Considering A2 as one of the 3 axioms for the quaternary congruence relation is somewhat conventional, because the transitivity of the congruence relation is automatically given by our choice to take the distance as this congruence relation in our definition of Tarski geometries.
