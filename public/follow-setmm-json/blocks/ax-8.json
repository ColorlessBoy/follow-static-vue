One of the equality and substitution axioms for a non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality. It substitutes equal variables into the left-hand side of an arbitrary binary predicate ` e. ` , which we will use for the set membership relation when set theory is introduced. This axiom scheme is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose general form cannot be represented with our notation. Also appears as Axiom scheme C12' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). \"Non-logical\" means that the predicate is not a primitive of predicate calculus proper but instead is an extension to it. \"Binary\" means that the predicate has two arguments. In a system of predicate calculus with equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a non-logical predicate. In systems of predicate calculus without equality, it typically would be. We prove in ~ ax8 that this axiom can be recovered from its weakened version ~ ax8v where ` x ` and ` y ` are assumed to be disjoint variables. In particular, the only theorem referencing ~ ax-8 should be ~ ax8v . See the comment of ~ ax8v for more details on these matters. (Contributed by NM, 30-Jun-1993.) (Revised by BJ, 7-Dec-2020.) Use ~ ax8 instead. (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["ax8v"]}
