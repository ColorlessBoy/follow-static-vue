All ` ph ` is ` ps ` , and all ` ch ` is ` ph ` , therefore all ` ch ` is ` ps ` . In Aristotelian notation, AAA-1: MaP and SaM therefore SaP. For example, given \"All men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\", we can prove \"Socrates is mortal\". If H is the set of men, M is the set of mortal beings, and S is Socrates, these word phrases can be represented as ` A. x ( x e. H -> x e. M ) ` (all men are mortal) and ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. H ) ` (Socrates is a man) therefore ` A. x ( x = S -> x e. M ) ` (Socrates is mortal). Russell and Whitehead note that \"the syllogism in Barbara is derived from [[ ~ syl ]\" (quote after Theorem *2.06 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 101). Most of the proof is in ~ alsyl . There are a legion of sources for Barbara, including ~ http://www.friesian.com/aristotl.htm , ~ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/ , and ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism .
