This acts on functions to produce a function that is defined where the original function is differentiable, with value the derivative of the function at these points. The set ` s ` here is the ambient topological space under which we are evaluating the continuity of the difference quotient. Although the definition is valid for any subset of ` CC ` and is well-behaved when ` s ` contains no isolated points, we will restrict our attention to the cases ` s = RR ` or ` s = CC ` for the majority of the development, these corresponding respectively to real and complex differentiation.
