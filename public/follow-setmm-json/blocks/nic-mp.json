Although the major and minor premise together also imply ` ch ` , this form is necessary for useful derivations from ~ nic-ax . In a pure (standalone) treatment of Nicod's axiom, this theorem would be changed to an axiom ($a statement). (Contributed by Jeff Hoffman, 19-Nov-2007.) (Proof modification is discouraged.)
