Note: Historically (prior to 21-Oct-2005), set.mm used the notation ` U. x e. A B ` , with the same union symbol as ~ cuni . While that syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm. The new syntax uses a distinguished symbol ` U_ ` instead of ` U. ` and does allow LALR parsing. Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting this change.","parent":[],"children":[]}
