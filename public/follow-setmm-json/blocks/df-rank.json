See ~ rankval , ~ rankval2 , ~ rankval3 , or ~ rankval4 its value. The rank is a kind of \"inverse\" of the cumulative hierarchy of sets function ` R1 ` : given a set, it returns an ordinal number telling us the smallest layer of the hierarchy to which the set belongs. Based on Definition 9.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 79. Theorem ~ rankid illustrates the \"inverse\" concept. Another nice theorem showing the relationship is ~ rankr1a .
