Tarski classes is a phrase coined by Grzegorz Bancerek in his article _Tarski's Classes and Ranks_, Journal of Formalized Mathematics, Vol 1, No 3, May-August 1990. A Tarski class is a set whose existence is ensured by Tarski's axiom A (see ~ ax-groth and the equivalent axioms). Axiom A was first presented in Tarski's article _&Uuml;ber unerreichbare Kardinalzahlen_. Tarski introduced the axiom A to enable ZFC to manage inaccessible cardinals. Later Grothendieck introduced the concept of Grothendieck universes and showed they were equal to transitive Tarski classes. (Contributed by FL, 30-Dec-2010.)","parent":[],"children":["eltskg"]}
