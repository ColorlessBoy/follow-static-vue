Axiom 4 of 22 for real and complex numbers, derived from ZF set theory. This construction-dependent theorem should not be referenced directly, nor should the proven axiom ~ ax-addcl be used later. Instead, in most cases use ~ addcl . (Contributed by NM, 14-Jun-1995.) (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":["fovcl","axaddf"],"children":[]}
