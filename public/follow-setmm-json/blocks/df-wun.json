A weak universe is a nonempty transitive class closed under union, pairing, and powerset. The advantage of weak universes over Grothendieck universes is that one can prove that every set is contained in a weak universe in ZF (see ~ uniwun ) whereas the analogue for Grothendieck universes requires ~ ax-groth (see ~ grothtsk ).
