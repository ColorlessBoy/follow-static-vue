This is to ~ df-mre what ~ df-top is to ~ df-topon . For the sake of consistency, the function defined at ~ df-mre should be denoted by \"MooreOn\". Note: ~ df-mre singles out the empty intersection. This is not necessary. It could be written instead ` Moore = ` ` ( x e. _V |-> { y e. ~P ~P x | A. z e. ~P y ( x i^i |^| z ) e. y } ) ` and the equivalence of both definitions is proved by ~ bj-0int . There is no added generality in defining a \"Moore predicate\" for arbitrary classes, since a Moore class satisfying such a predicate is automatically a set (see ~ bj-mooreset ).
