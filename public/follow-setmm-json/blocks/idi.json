They can be ignored if you are using this database to assist learning logic; please start with the statement ~ wn instead.) This inference says \"if ` ph ` is true then ` ph ` is true\". This inference requires no axioms for its proof, and is useful as a copy-paste mechanism during proof development in mmj2. It is normally not referenced in the final version of a proof, since it is always redundant. You can remove this using the metamath-exe (Metamath program) Proof Assistant using the \"MM-PA> MINIMIZE_WITH *\" command. This is the inference associated with ~ id , hence its name.
