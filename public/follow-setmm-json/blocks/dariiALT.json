This shows how the use of ~ spi may shorten some proofs of the Aristotelian syllogisms, even though this adds axiom dependencies. Note that ~ spi is the inference associated with ~ sp , which corresponds to the axiom (T) of modal logic. (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 27-Aug-2016.) Added precisions on axiom usage.
