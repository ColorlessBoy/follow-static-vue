Read: \"(the function) ` F ` is defined at (the argument) ` A ` \". In a previous version, the token \"def@\" was used. However, since the @ is used (informally) as a replacement for $ in commented out sections that may be deleted some day. While there is no violation of any standard to use the @ in a token, it could make the search for such commented-out sections slightly more difficult.
