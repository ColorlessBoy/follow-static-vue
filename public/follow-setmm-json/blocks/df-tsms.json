If ` G ` is Hausdorff, then there will be at most one element in this set and ` U. ( W tsums F ) ` selects this unique element if it exists. ` ( W tsums F ) ~~ 1o ` is a way to say that the sum exists and is unique. Note that unlike ` sum_ ` ( ~ df-sum ) and ` gsum ` ( ~ df-gsum ), this does not return the sum itself, but rather the set of all such sums, which is usually either empty or a singleton.
