Note that this will not actually be a group for the average ring, or even for a field, but it will be a monoid, and ~ unitgrp shows that we get a group if we restrict to the elements that have inverses. This allows us to formalize such notions as \"the multiplication operation of a ring is a monoid\" ( ~ ringmgp ) or \"the multiplicative identity\" in terms of the identity of a monoid ( ~ df-1r ).
