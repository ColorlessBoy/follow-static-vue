Axiom A1 of [Margaris] p. 49. One of the 3 axioms of propositional calculus. The 3 axioms are also given as Definition 2.1 of [Hamilton] p. 28. This axiom is called _Simp_ or \"the principle of simplification\" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because \"it enables us to pass from the joint assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply\". It is Proposition 1 of [Frege1879] p. 26, its first axiom.
