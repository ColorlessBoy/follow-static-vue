This is a shorthand for listing the necessary conditions for a structure to admit a canonical embedding of ` RR ` into it. Interestingly, this is not coming from a mathematical reference, but was from the necessary conditions to build the embedding at each step ( ` ZZ ` , ` QQ ` and ` RR ` ). It would be interesting see if this is formally treated in the literature. See ~ isrrext for a better readable version.
