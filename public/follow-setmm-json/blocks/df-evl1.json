The function ` ( eval1 `` R ) : V --> ( R ^m R ) ` makes sense when ` R ` is a ring, and ` V ` is the set of polynomials in ` ( Poly1 `` R ) ` . This function maps an element of the formal polynomial algebra (with coefficients in ` R ` ) to a function from assignments to the variable from ` R ` into an element of ` R ` formed by evaluating the polynomial with the given assignment.
