Here, the measurable spaces are given using their sigma-algebras ` s ` and ` t ` , and the spaces themselves are recovered by ` U. s ` and ` U. t ` . Note the similarities between the definition of measurable functions in measure theory, and of continuous functions in topology. This is the definition for the generic measure theory. For the specific case of functions from ` RR ` to ` CC ` , see ~ df-mbf . (Contributed by Thierry Arnoux, 23-Jan-2017.)","parent":[],"children":["ismbfm","elunirnmbfm"]}
