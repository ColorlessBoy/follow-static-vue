Unlike ` Om1 ` this is actually a _pointed_ topological space, which is to say a tuple of a topological space (a member of ` TopSp ` , not ` Top ` ) and a point in the space. Higher loop spaces select the constant loop at the point from the lower loop space for the distinguished point. (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 10-Jul-2015.)","parent":[],"children":[""]}
