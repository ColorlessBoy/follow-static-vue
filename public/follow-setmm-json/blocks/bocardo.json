Some ` ph ` is not ` ps ` , and all ` ph ` is ` ch ` , therefore some ` ch ` is not ` ps ` . Instance of ~ disamis . In Aristotelian notation, OAO-3: MoP and MaS therefore SoP. For example, \"Some cats have no tails\", \"All cats are mammals\", therefore \"Some mammals have no tails\". (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 28-Aug-2016.)","parent":["disamis"],"children":[]}
