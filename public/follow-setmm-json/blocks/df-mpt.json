Read as \"the function which maps ` x ` (in ` A ` ) to ` B ( x ) ` \". The class expression ` B ` is the value of the function at ` x ` and normally contains the variable ` x ` . An example is the square function for complex numbers, ` ( x e. CC |-> ( x ^ 2 ) ) ` . Similar to the definition of mapping in [ChoquetDD] p. 2.
