This is a \"temporary\" set used in the construction of complex numbers ~ df-c , and is intended to be used only by the construction.

The actual positive fraction addition ` +Q ` ( ~ df-plq ) works with the equivalence classes of these ordered pairs determined by the equivalence relation ` ~Q ` ( ~ df-enq ).
