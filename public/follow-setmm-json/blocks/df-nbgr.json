The neighborhood/neighbors of a vertex are all (other) vertices which are connected with this vertex by an edge. In contrast to a closed neighborhood, a vertex is not a neighbor of itself. This definition is applicable even for arbitrary hypergraphs. Remark: To distinguish this definition from other definitions for neighborhoods resp. neighbors (e.g., ` nei ` in Topology, see ~ df-nei ), the suffix ` Vtx ` is added to the class constant ` NeighbVtx ` .
