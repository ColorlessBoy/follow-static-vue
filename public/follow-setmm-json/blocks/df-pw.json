Definition 5.10 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 17, but we also let it apply to proper classes, i.e. those that are not members of ` _V ` . When applied to a set, this produces its power set. A power set of S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. For example, if ` A = { 3 , 5 , 7 } ` , then ` ~P A = { (/) , { 3 } , { 5 } , { 7 } , { 3 , 5 } , ` ` { 3 , 7 } , { 5 , 7 } , { 3 , 5 , 7 } } ` ( ~ ex-pw ). We will later introduce the Axiom of Power Sets ~ ax-pow , which can be expressed in class notation per ~ pwexg . Still later we will prove, in ~ hashpw , that the size of the power set of a finite set is 2 raised to the power of the size of the set.
