Postulate (S1) of [Beran] p. 95. Note that ` * `` x ` is the complex conjugate ~ cjval of ` x ` . In the literature, the inner product of ` A ` and ` B ` is usually written ` <. A , B >. ` , but our operation notation ~ co allows us to use existing theorems about operations and also avoids a clash with the definition of an ordered pair ~ df-op . Physicists use ` <. B | A >. ` , called Dirac bra-ket notation, to represent this operation; see comments in ~ df-bra . (Contributed by NM, 29-Jul-1999.)
