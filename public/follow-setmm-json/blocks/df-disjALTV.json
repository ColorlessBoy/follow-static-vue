A disjoint relation is a converse function of the relation by ~ dfdisjALTV , see the comment of ~ df-disjs why we need disjoint relations instead of converse functions anyway. The element of the class of disjoints and the disjoint predicate are the same, that is ` ( R e. Disjs <-> Disj R ) ` when ` R ` is a set, see ~ eldisjsdisj .
