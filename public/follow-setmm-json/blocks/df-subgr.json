A class ` s ` is a _subgraph_ of a class ` g ` (the _supergraph_ of ` s ` ) if its vertices are also vertices of ` g ` , and its edges are also edges of ` g ` , connecting vertices of ` s ` only (see section I.1 in [Bollobas] p. 2 or section 1.1 in [Diestel] p. 4). The second condition is ensured by the requirement that the edge function of ` s ` is a restriction of the edge function of ` g ` having only vertices of ` s ` in its range. Note that the domains of the edge functions of the subgraph and the supergraph should be compatible. (Contributed by AV, 16-Nov-2020.)","parent":[],"children":["relsubgr","issubgr"]}
