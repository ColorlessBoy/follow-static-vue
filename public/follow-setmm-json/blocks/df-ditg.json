The ` A ` and ` B ` here are the lower and upper limits of the integral, usually written as a subscript and superscript next to the integral sign. We define the region of integration to be an open interval instead of closed so that we can use ` +oo , -oo ` for limits and also integrate up to a singularity at an endpoint.
