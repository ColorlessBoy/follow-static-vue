Enderton uses a bold \"X\" with ` x e. A ` written underneath or as a subscript, as does Stoll p. 47. Some books use a capital pi, but we will reserve that notation for products of numbers. Usually ` B ` represents a class expression containing ` x ` free and thus can be thought of as ` B ( x ) ` . Normally, ` x ` is not free in ` A ` , although this is not a requirement of the definition. (Contributed by NM, 28-Sep-2006.)","parent":[],"children":["dfixp","ss2ixp","nfixp","nfixp1","ixpn0"]}
