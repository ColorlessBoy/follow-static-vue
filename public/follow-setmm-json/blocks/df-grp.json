A group is a monoid ( ~ df-mnd ) whose internal operation is such that every element admits a left inverse (which can be proven to be a two-sided inverse). Thus, a group ` G ` is an algebraic structure formed from a base set of elements (notated ` ( Base `` G ) ` per ~ df-base ) and an internal group operation (notated ` ( +g `` G ) ` per ~ df-plusg ). The operation combines any two elements of the group base set and must satisfy the 4 group axioms: closure (the result of the group operation must always be a member of the base set, see ~ grpcl ), associativity (so ` ( ( a +g b ) +g c ) = ( a +g ( b +g c ) ) ` for any a, b, c, see ~ grpass ), identity (there must be an element ` e = ( 0g `` G ) ` such that ` e +g a = a +g e = a ` for any a), and inverse (for each element a in the base set, there must be an element ` b = invg a ` in the base set such that ` a +g b = b +g a = e ` ). It can be proven that the identity element is unique ( ~ grpideu ). Groups need not be commutative; a commutative group is an Abelian group (see ~ df-abl ). Subgroups can often be formed from groups, see ~ df-subg . An example of an (Abelian) group is the set of complex numbers ` CC ` over the group operation ` + ` (addition), as proven in ~ cnaddablx ; an Abelian group is a group as proven in ~ ablgrp . Other structures include groups, including unital rings ( ~ df-ring ) and fields ( ~ df-field ). (Contributed by NM, 17-Oct-2012.)
