Definition 5.20 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 21. Also Definition 2.9 of [Quine] p. 19. The class ` _V ` can be described as the \"class of all sets\"; ~ vprc proves that ` _V ` is not itself a set in ZFC. We will frequently use the expression ` A e. _V ` as a short way to say \" ` A ` is a set\", and ~ isset proves that this expression has the same meaning as ` E. x x = A ` . The class ` _V ` is called the \"von Neumann universe\", however, the letter \"V\" is not a tribute to the name of von Neumann. The letter \"V\" was used earlier by Peano in 1889 for the universe of sets, where the letter V is derived from the word \"Verum\". Peano's notation V was adopted by Whitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica for the class of all sets in 1910. For a general discussion of the theory of classes, see ~ mmset.html#class .
