A quantified wff implies the wff without a quantifier (i.e. an instance, or special case, of the generalized wff). In other words if something is true for all ` x ` , it is true for any specific ` x ` (that would typically occur as a free variable in the wff substituted for ` ph ` ). (A free variable is one that does not occur in the scope of a quantifier: ` x ` and ` y ` are both free in ` x = y ` , but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .) Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint). Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski] p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77). Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule ~ ax-gen . Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-13 , ~ ax-c14 , ~ ax-c16 , and ~ ax-5 . Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose a variable different from ` x ` for the special case. For use, that requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later after we introduce the definition of proper substitution - see ~ stdpc4 . An interesting alternate axiomatization uses ~ axc5c711 and ~ ax-c4 in place of ~ ax-c5 , ~ ax-4 , ~ ax-10 , and ~ ax-11 . This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used. It is proved above as theorem ~ sp . (Contributed by NM, 3-Jan-1993.)
