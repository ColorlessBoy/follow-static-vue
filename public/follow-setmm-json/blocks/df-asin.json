Because ` sin ` is not a one-to-one function, the literal inverse ` ``' sin ` is not a function. Rather than attempt to find the right domain on which to restrict ` sin ` in order to get a total function, we just define it in terms of ` log ` , which we already know is total (except at ` 0 ` ). There are branch points at ` -u 1 ` and ` 1 ` (at which the function is defined), and branch cuts along the real line not between ` -u 1 ` and ` 1 ` , which is to say ` ( -oo , -u 1 ) u. ( 1 , +oo ) ` . (Contributed by Mario Carneiro, 31-Mar-2015.)","parent":[],"children":["asinf","asinval","dvasin"]}
