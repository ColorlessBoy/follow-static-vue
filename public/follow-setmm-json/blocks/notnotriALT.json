Inference associated with ~ notnotr . Remark: the proof via ~ notnotr and ~ ax-mp also has three essential steps, but has a total number of steps equal to 8, instead of the present 7, because it has to construct the formula ` ph ` twice and the formula ` -. -. ph ` once, whereas the present proof has to construct the formula ` ph ` twice and the formula ` -. ph ` once, and therefore makes only one use of ~ wn instead of two. This can be checked by running the Metamath command \"MM> SHOW PROOF notnotri / NORMAL\". (Contributed by NM, 27-Feb-2008.) (Proof shortened by Wolf Lammen, 15-Jul-2021.)
