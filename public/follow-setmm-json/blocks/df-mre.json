Elements of a Moore collection are termed _closed_; Moore collections generalize the notion of closedness from topologies ( ~ cldmre ) and vector spaces ( ~ lssmre ) to the most general setting in which such concepts make sense. Definition of Moore collection of sets in [Schechter] p. 78. A Moore collection may also be called a _closure system_ (Section 0.6 in [Gratzer] p. 23.) The name _Moore collection_ is after Eliakim Hastings Moore, who discussed these systems in Part I of [Moore] p. 53 to 76. See ~ ismre , ~ mresspw , ~ mre1cl and ~ mreintcl for the major properties of a Moore collection. Note that a Moore collection uniquely determines its base set ( ~ mreuni ); as such the disjoint union of all Moore collections is sometimes considered as ` U. ran Moore ` , justified by ~ mreunirn .
