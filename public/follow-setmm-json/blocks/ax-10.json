Axiom C5-2 of [Monk2] p. 113. This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax10w ) but is used as an auxiliary axiom scheme to achieve scheme completeness. It means that ` x ` is not free in ` -. A. x ph ` . (Contributed by NM, 21-May-2008.) Use its alias ~ hbn1 instead if you must use it. Any theorem in first order logic (FOL) that contains only set variables that are all mutually distinct, and has no wff variables, can be proved *without* using ~ ax-10 through ~ ax-13 , by invoking ~ ax10w through ~ ax13w . We encourage proving theorems *without* ~ ax-10 through ~ ax-13 and moving them up to the ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-9 section. (New usage is discouraged.)","parent":[],"children":["hbn1"]}
