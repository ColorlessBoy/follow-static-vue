The orthogonal complement is the set of all vectors orthogonal to all vectors in the subset. See ~ ocval and ~ chocvali for its value. Textbooks usually denote this unary operation with the symbol ` _|_ ` as a small superscript, although Mittelstaedt uses the symbol as a prefix operation. Here we define a function (prefix operation) ` _|_ ` rather than introducing a new syntactic form. This lets us take advantage of the theorems about functions that we already have proved under set theory. Definition of [Mittelstaedt] p. 9. (Contributed by NM, 7-Aug-2000.)
